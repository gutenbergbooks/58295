<p><i>The National Park Service is primarily a custodian of and
trustee for lands&mdash;lands with unique and special qualities,
so distinctive as to make their care a concern of the entire
nation; lands, therefore, held under a distinctive pattern and
policy, administered according to the national park concept.</i></p>
<p><i>Yosemite National Park comprises such lands. It is, so to
speak, a type locality for the national park idea. While Yellowstone,
established in 1872, was the first real national park,
Yosemite Valley, in 1864, under an act signed by President Lincoln,
was transferred to the State of California to be protected
according to park principles, later to be re-ceded to the Federal
Government. Here in Yosemite many of the national park
policies and techniques of protection, administration, and interpretation
have evolved and are still evolving, within the
framework of the basic act of 1916, with its injunction to &ldquo;conserve
the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the
wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same
in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired
for the enjoyment of future generations.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>Dr. Russell&rsquo;s <span class="f">One Hundred Years in Yosemite</span>, appearing
now in its new version, gives not only a chronology of events,
and the persons taking part in them, related to this place of
very special beauty and meaning. It also portrays, in terms of
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
human experience, the growth of a distinct and unique conception
of land management and chronicles the thoughts and
effort of those who contributed to it. It tells of the obstacles
overcome, and of the pressures, present even today, to break
down the national park concept, and turn these lands to commercial
and other ends that would deface their beauty and
impair their significance.</i></p>
<p><i>This book, therefore, is more than a history of Yosemite. It
traces the evolution of an idea.</i></p>
<p><i>In scholarly fashion, sources of information are cited. Many
of the documents and other source materials upon which the
book is based are preserved in the Yosemite Museum, thus giving
special interest to visitors to Yosemite.</i></p>
<p><i>Belief in the worth of the national park program cannot but
be strengthened by reading <span class="f">One Hundred Years in Yosemite</span>.</i></p>

<h2 class="i">PREFACE</h2>
<p><i>It is the purpose of <span class="f">One Hundred Years in Yosemite</span> to
preserve and disseminate the true story of the discovery
and preservation of America&rsquo;s first public reservation to be set
aside for its natural beauty and scientific interest.</i></p>
<p><i>When the original version of this book was written in 1930,
I had recently completed the collation of manuscript diaries
and correspondence, newspaper files, old journals, hotel registers,
state and federal reports, photographs, and a variety of
other pertinent historical source materials in the library of the
Yosemite Museum. This was the material upon which the book
was based. In the preface of the book I made a plea for the contribution
of additional Yosemite memorabilia to be added to
the Yosemite archives. Perhaps some of the fine response from
donors during the past sixteen years is traceable to that plea;
more likely, the increased interest in the Yosemite Museum
results from the creditable work of the park&rsquo;s staff members
and the message carried by the monthly publication, <span class="f">Yosemite
Nature Notes</span>. The notable growth of the Yosemite Museum
collections and the improvement of its exhibits and its general
program of interpretive work are heartening to all who had
a hand in the establishment of the work.</i></p>
<p><i>In the original version, and in bringing to the present work
the benefit of new material, I have attempted to organize the
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
published information which has been confirmed by the oral
testimony of many Yosemite pioneers and enriched with authentic
data from unpublished manuscripts prepared by other
&ldquo;old-timers&rdquo; to whom I could not speak. In order that a convenient
chronology of events might be available to the reader, an
outline is appended to the book. This includes the episodes related
in the text and in addition mentions many obscure events
not treated in the narrative. It also provides ready reference
to the sources drawn upon in writing. This method of citing
sources has made it unnecessary to encumber the pages of the
text with numerous footnotes. Most of the manuscripts referred
to are the property of the Yosemite Museum. The whereabouts
of other manuscripts is indicated in the bibliography.</i></p>
<p><i>To the donors of the expanding collection of source materials
and to the Yosemite staff members, also, who have accomplished
so much in organizing, interpreting, and publishing
upon these materials, I am indebted. Their interest and their
labors have facilitated my present writing, and their conscientious
handling of file systems, accession records, stored collections,
and publication programs will facilitate the work of
future investigators of Yosemite history and natural history.
At the same time, their good museum practices should inspire
further public confidence in the integrity of the Yosemite program,
and the collections will continue to grow.</i></p>

<p><i>A host of friends and associates have contributed to the
production of the book. Great thanks are due my wife for her
generous help and continuous encouragement. Mrs. H. J. Taylor
lent important assistance and advice. Among the Yosemite
staff members who gave valuable help, former Park Naturalists</i>
<i>C. A. Harwell and C. Frank Brockman and former museum-secretary,
Mrs. William Godfrey, made especially important
contributions; however, the extraordinary interest of every
member of the park naturalist staff has placed me in the debt
of the entire organization. The American Association of Museums,
in addition to co&ouml;perating with the National Park
Service in founding the Yosemite Museum, has contributed
directly to the production of this book by assisting me in the
collecting of rare publications and helping, generally, in assembling
Yosemite data. The Yosemite Park and Curry Company
has made available many publications and photographs. Mrs.
Don Tresidder of that organization, particularly, has given
material assistance in establishing dates and historical facts.
The Sierra Club has permitted the use of my article, &ldquo;Mining
Excitements East of Yosemite,&rdquo; which was first published in
the <span class="f">Sierra Club Bulletin</span>. To David R. Brower, Editor of the
<span class="f">Sierra Club Bulletin</span> and at the University of California Press,
I acknowledge particular indebtedness, not only for editorial
guidance in producing the book but, also, for his historian&rsquo;s
sense and his basic knowledge of the Yosemite terrain and its
story. Some of his contributions to the content of the text are
acknowledged elsewhere, but his friendly help has extended to
every part of the book. Francis P. Farquhar and Ansel F. Hall,
during a quarter of a century of our friendships, have given
assistance and encouragement. Mr. Farquhar has read parts of
the manuscript and made helpful suggestions. His library has
been drawn upon in the course of my work. The more recent
photographs reproduced upon the following pages are credited
to their makers, to each of whom I am deeply beholden. For
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
use of the very old pictures used herein, I am indebted to the
Yosemite Museum, and to Superintendent Frank Kittredge I
express thanks for this and many other helpful acts performed
by him and his staff members in furthering my efforts.</i></p>
<p><i>In the sixteen years that have elapsed since <span class="f">One Hundred
Years in Yosemite</span> first appeared, notable changes have taken
place in the geographical boundaries of the national park,
physical developments within the reservation have, so far as
possible, kept pace with progressing modes of vacationing, and
some eight million visitors have journeyed to its wonders. A
number of the historic caravansaries that served so conspicuously
during stagecoach days have been removed from the
scene, and the one-time dusty, tortuous routes of access have
been converted to safe, surfaced roads of beautiful alignment.
A world-shaking conflict has been waged, and the superlative
values of the park have emerged from that war unaffected by
the demands of &ldquo;production&rdquo; interests.</i></p>
<p><i>Many earnest men have applied themselves in guarding the
precious values of the great reservation. Some of these conservationists
have virtually died in the harness. A growing
appreciation of the work of these men is evident, and there is
notable acclaim also of the far-sightedness of unnamed leaders
who in 1864 obtained the epoch-making legislation that gave
America her first public reservation of national park caliber.</i></p>
<p><i>It has been gratifying to me to observe some practical usefulness
of my original compilation of Yosemite history, and
this new version of the work is offered with the hope that it
may continue to guide public attention to the significance of
the action of pioneers who led the world along the paths of
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
scenic conservation. Upon the executives who now plan and
administer programs of protection and management in Yosemite
rests a responsibility that gains in magnitude in proportion
to the growing pressure exerted by the hordes of people who
seek the offerings of the park. The nation is yet in a pioneering
stage in defining Yosemite values and regulating their use. In
the light of experience of the past, it should be possible to discern
some of the path that lies ahead.</i></p>
<p><i>The ability to discern even the more subtle influences affecting
the security of Yosemite and other great national parks has
become a &ldquo;must&rdquo; for National Park Service executives. This
sensitivity has not developed overnight, but now it approaches
maturity. Director Newton B. Drury has exercised a leadership
in this regard which marks his period of service as the apex
of clear thinking on national park problems.</i></p>

<br /><i>DISCOVERY</i></h2>
<p>That picturesque type known as the American trapper
ushered in the opening event of Sierra Nevada history.
True, the Spaniards of the previous century had viewed the
&ldquo;snowy range of mountains,&rdquo; had applied the name Sierra Nevada,
and even had visited its western base. But penetration of
the wild and snowy fastness awaited the coming of Americans.</p>
<p>In the opening decades of the nineteenth century the entire
American West was occupied by scattered bands of trappers.
From the ranks of the &ldquo;Fur Brigade&rdquo; came Jedediah Strong
Smith, a youthful fur trader, not yet thirty years old but experienced
in his profession and well educated for his time. In
the summer of 1826 he took his place at the head of a party
of men organized to explore the unknown region lying between
Great Salt Lake and the California coast. Smith&rsquo;s leadership of
this party gave him a first place in the history of the Sierra
Nevada. His party left the Salt Lake rendezvous on August 22,
1826. A southwest course was followed across the deserts of
Utah and Nevada, penetrating the Mojave country and the
Cajon Pass. On November 27 they went into camp near Mission
San Gabriel. Smith was thus the first American to make
the transcontinental journey to California, the harbinger of a
great overland human flood.</p>
<p>The Spanish governor of California refused to permit the
party to travel north as Smith had planned. Instead, he instructed
that they should quit California by the route used in
entering. Reinforced with food, clothing, and horses supplied
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
by the friendly Mission San Gabriel, Smith returned to the
neighborhood of the Cajon Pass. It was not his intention, however,
to be easily deterred in his plan to explore California. He
followed the Sierra Madre to the junction of the Coast Ranges
and the Sierra Nevada and entered the San Joaquin Valley.</p>
<p>He found the great interior valley inhabited by large numbers
of Indians, who were in no way hostile or dangerous. There
were &ldquo;few beaver and elk, deer and antelope in abundance.&rdquo;
Reaching one of the streams flowing from the mountains, he
determined to cross the Sierra Nevada and return to Great Salt
Lake. Smith called this stream the Wimmelche after a tribe of
Indians by that name who inhabited the region thereabouts.
C. Hart Merriam has established the fact that Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wimmelche&rdquo;
is the Kings River, and the time of his arrival there
as February of 1827. Since the passes of the Sierra in this region
are never open before the advent of summer, it is not surprising
that his party failed in this attempted crossing of the range.
Authorities have differed in their interpretation of Smith&rsquo;s
writing regarding his ultimate success in traversing the Sierra,
but there is little doubt that he crossed north of the Yosemite
region, perhaps as far north as the American River.</p>
<p>Smith was, then, the first white man known to have crossed
the Sierra Nevada. His pathfinding exploits did not take him
into the limits of the present Yosemite National Park, but because
his manuscript maps were made available to government
officials who influenced later expeditions and because he was
the first to explore the mountain region of which the Yosemite
is an outstanding feature, his expedition provides the opening
story in any account of Yosemite affairs.</p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s explorations paved the way for a notable influx of
American trappers to the valleys west of the Sierra Nevada.
Smith, in fact, returned to California that same summer. Pattie,
Young, Ogden, Wolfskill, Jackson, and Walker all brought
parties to the new fields during the first five years following the
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
Smith venture. Fur traders informed the settlers in the western
states of the easy life in California and enticed them with stories
of the undeveloped resources of the Pacific slope. Pioneers were
then occupying much of the country just west of the Missouri,
and a gradual tide of westward emigration brought attention
first to Oregon and then to California.</p>
<p>The presence of Americans in California greatly annoyed
the Mexican officials of the country. The fears of these officials
were justified, for the trappers scarcely concealed their desire
to overthrow Mexican authority and assume control themselves.
To add to the threatened confusion, revolt brewed
among the Mexicans who held the land.</p>
<p>In 1832 Captain B. L. E. Bonneville secured leave of absence
from the United States Army and launched a private venture in
exploring and trapping. One Joseph Reddeford Walker, who
had achieved fame as a frontiersman, was engaged by Bonneville
to take charge of a portion of his command. Walker&rsquo;s party
of explorers was ordered to cross the desert west of Great Salt
Lake and visit California. Reliable knowledge of the Sierra
Nevada and the first inkling of the existence of Yosemite Valley
resulted from this expedition, made in 1833.</p>
<p>Joseph Walker, born in 1798 on the Tennessee River near
the present Knoxville, Tennessee, had moved westward with
the advancing frontier in 1818 to the extreme western boundary
of Missouri. There he and his brothers rented government
land near the Indian Factory, Fort Osage. They put in a crop
and during slack seasons mingled with the Osages and the
Kanzas Indians. Here Walker formed his first ideas of trade
with the Indians&mdash;ideas which bore fruit during his later experiences
on the Santa Fe Trail and with the fur brigades in
the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>Early in 1831, Walker, enroute southward from his home to
buy horses, stopped at Fort Gibson in the heart of the Cherokee
Nation in the eastern part of the present Oklahoma. Several
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
companies of the 7th U. S. Infantry were stationed here. This
circumstance brought about a sequence of events which left
permanent marks upon Walker&rsquo;s personal career and upon
the history of the American West. Captain B. L. E. Bonneville
was in command of B Company of the 7th Infantry. Bonneville
confided in Walker that the government was about to place
him on detached service in order that he might conduct a
private expedition into the Rocky Mountains for furs and
geographical data. He asked Walker to join him as guide and
counselor. To this proposal Walker acceded enthusiastically
and proceeded forthwith to organize the equipment and personnel
needed for the venture.</p>
<p>On the first of May, 1832, Bonneville and Walker led westward
a caravan of twenty wagons attended by one hundred and
ten mounted trappers, hunters, and servants from the Missouri
River landing where Fort Osage had once stood. Out upon the
Kansas plains they went, up the Platte, to the Sweetwater, and
through South Pass. In the valleys of the Green and the Snake
they trapped and traded through the winter and spring of
1832-33. After the rendezvous on the Green in July, 1833,
Walker was named by Bonneville to be the leader of the now
famous Walker expedition to the Pacific.</p>
<p>The reports of Jedediah Smith on his trip of 1826 to California
and the much talked about adventures of Smith, as
discussed by the mountain men, seem to have been decisive
factors which influenced Bonneville to authorize this ambitious
undertaking. The fact that a scant 4,000 pounds of beaver
was all he had to show for his campaign of the past year also
may have contributed to his determination to take another
fling at exploration, trapping, and the trade. Walker&rsquo;s California
party consisted of fifty men, with four horses each, a year&rsquo;s
supply of food, ammunition, and trade goods. Zenas Leonard
and George Nidever, two free trappers who had joined the
Bonneville crowd at the Green River rendezvous, were selected
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
as members of the Walker party. Both were to become conspicuous
in California history by virtue of their writings.</p>
<p>Because Walker was the first white man to lead a party of
explorers to the brink of Yosemite&rsquo;s cliffs, he is given a first
place in Yosemite history. It is worthwhile to record here some
of the appraisals of Walker, the man, made by his contemporaries
and companions.</p>
<p>Zenas Leonard, clerk of the Walker party, wrote, &ldquo;Mr.
Walker was a man well calculated to undertake a business of
this kind [the California expedition]. He was well hardened
to the hardships of the wilderness&mdash;understood the character of
the Indians very well ... was kind and affable to his men, but at
the same time at liberty to command without giving offence ...
and to explore unknown regions was his chief delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Washington Irving said of Walker, &ldquo;About six feet high,
strong built, dark complexioned, brave in spirit, though mild
in manners. He had resided for many years in Missouri, on the
frontier; had been among the earliest adventurers to Santa Fe,
where he went to trap beaver, and was taken by the Spaniards.
Being liberated, he engaged with the Spaniards and Sioux
Indians in a war against the Pawnees; then returned to Missouri,
and had acted by turns as sheriff, trader, trapper, until
he was enlisted as a leader by Captain Bonneville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hubert Howe Bancroft, the historian, estimated, &ldquo;Captain
Joe Walker was one of the bravest and most skillful of the
mountain men; none was better acquainted than he with the
geography or the native tribes of the Great Basin; and he was
withal less boastful and pretentious than most of his class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walker&rsquo;s biographer, Douglas S. Watson, referring to Bonneville&rsquo;s
effort to blame the financial failure of his western
enterprises upon a scapegoat, stated, &ldquo;Whatever may have
been Bonneville&rsquo;s purpose in besmirching Walker in which
Irving so willingly lent himself, he has hardly succeeded, for
where one person today knows the name Bonneville, thousands
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
regard Captain Joseph Reddeford Walker as one of the
foremost of western explorers, worthy to be grouped with Jedediah
Strong Smith and Ewing Young as the trilogy responsible
for the march of this nation to the shores of the Pacific; the
true pathfinders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walker&rsquo;s perseverance in completing his California journey
grew out of a solemn determination to make a personal contribution
to the expansion of the United States westward to the
Pacific. His cavalcade crossed the Great Basin west of Great
Salt Lake via the valley of the Humboldt and, passing south
by Carson Lake and the Bridgeport Valley, struck westward
into the Sierra Nevada. The exact course they took across
the Sierra has been a matter of conjecture; some students
have attempted to identify it with the Truckee route, and
others have maintained that no ascent was made until the party
reached the stream now known as Walker River. It seems probable
that they climbed the eastern flank of the Sierra by one
of the southern tributaries of the East Walker River. Once over
the crest of the range, they traveled west along the divide between
the Tuolumne and the Merced rivers directly into the
heart of the present Yosemite National Park.</p>
<p>In Leonard&rsquo;s narrative is found the following very significant
comment regarding the crossing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We travelled a few miles every day, still on top of the mountain,
and our course continually obstructed with snow hills and rocks.
Here we began to encounter in our path many small streams which
would shoot out from under these high snow-banks, and after
running a short distance in deep chasms which they have through
the ages cut in the rocks, precipitate themselves from one lofty
precipice to another, until they are exhausted in rain below. Some
of these precipices appeared to us to be more than a mile high.
Some of the men thought that if we could succeed in descending
one of these precipices to the bottom, we might thus work our way
into the valley below&mdash;but on making several attempts we found
it utterly impossible for a man to descend, to say nothing of our
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
horses. We were then obliged to keep along the top of the dividing
ridge between two of these chasms which seemed to lead pretty near
in the direction we were going&mdash;which was west,&mdash;in passing over
the mountain, supposing it to run north and south.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Walker&rsquo;s tombstone, in Martinez, California, bears the inscription,
&ldquo;Camped at Yosemite Nov. 13, 1833.&rdquo; Leonard&rsquo;s description
of their route belies the idea of his having camped
in Yosemite Valley, and the date is obviously an error as there
is reliable evidence that Walker had reached the San Joaquin
plain before this date. L. H. Bunnell in his <i>Discovery of the
Yosemite</i> records the following regarding Walker&rsquo;s route and
his Yosemite camp sites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The topography of the country over which the Mono Trail ran,
and which was followed by Capt. Walker, did not admit of his seeing
the valley proper. The depression indicating the valley, and its
magnificent surroundings, could alone have been discovered, and
in Capt. Walker&rsquo;s conversations with me at various times while
encamped between Coulterville and the Yosemite, he was manly
enough to say so. Upon one occasion I told Capt. Walker that
Ten-ie-ya had said that, &ldquo;A small party of white men once crossed
the mountains on the north side, but were so guided as not to see
the Valley proper.&rdquo; With a smile the Captain said, &ldquo;That was my
party, but I was not deceived, for the lay of the land showed there
was a valley below; but we had become nearly barefooted, our
animals poor, and ourselves on the verge of starvation; so we followed
down the ridge to Bull Creek, where, killing a deer, we went
into camp.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Francis Farquhar, in his article, &ldquo;Walker&rsquo;s Discovery of
Yosemite,&rdquo; analyzes the problem of Walker&rsquo;s route through the
Yosemite region and shows clearly that the Walker party was
not guided by Indians. He concludes quite rightly that Bunnell
was not justified in depriving Walker of the distinction
of discovering Yosemite Valley. Douglas S. Watson, in his volume,
<i>West Wind: The Life of Joseph Reddeford Walker</i>, offers
further evidence to this end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>It requires no great stretch of the imagination to visualize
scouts along the flanks of the Walker party coming out upon
the brink of Yosemite Valley and looking down in wonder
upon the plunging waters of Yosemite Falls and, perhaps, venturing
to the edge of the Hetch Hetchy. In any case we have
in the 1839 account by Leonard the first authentic printed
reference to the Yosemite region. Another passage from this
narrative must be quoted here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last two days travelling we have found some trees of the
Redwood species, incredibly large&mdash;some of which would measure
from 16 to 18 fathom round the trunk at the height of a man&rsquo;s head
from the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the first published mention of the Big Trees of the
Sierra. If we accept Bunnell&rsquo;s contention that the Walker party
camped at Bull Creek (Hazel Green), we will also agree that the
party followed the old Mono Trail of the Indians. This route
would have taken them near the Merced Grove of Big Trees.
There is probably no way of determining definitely whether
the Merced Grove, the Tuolumne Grove, or both, were seen
by Walker&rsquo;s men, but this incident so casually mentioned is
clearly the discovery of the famous Big Trees, and here for the
first time is a scholarly record of observations made in the present
Yosemite National Park. We may accept Leonard&rsquo;s writings
as the earliest document in Yosemite history and the Walker
party as the discoverer of both the Yosemite Valley and the
<i>Sequoia gigantea</i>.</p>

<br /><i>MARIPOSA HILLS</i></h2>
<p>Following the significant work of the early overland fur
traders there came a decade of immigration of bona fide
California settlers. The same forces that led the pioneer across
the Alleghenies, thence to the Mississippi, and from the Mississippi
into Texas, explain the coming of American settlers into
California. Hard times in the East stimulated land hunger,
and California publicity agents spread their propaganda at an
opportune time. Long before railroads, commercial clubs, and
real estate interests began to advertise the charms of California,
its advantages were widely heralded by the venturesome Americans
who had visited and sensed the possibilities of the province.
The press of the nation took up the story, and the people
of the United States were taught to look upon California as a
land of infinite promise, abounding in agricultural and commercial
possibilities, full of game, rich in timber, possessed of
perfect climate, and feebly held by an effeminate people quite
lacking in enterprise and disorganized among themselves.</p>
<p>The tide of emigration resulting from this painting of word
pictures began its surge in 1841 with the organization of the
Bidwell-Bartleson party. Other parties followed in quick succession,
and many of the pioneer fur hunters of the preceding
decade found themselves in demand as guides. The settlers
came on horseback, in ox wagon, or on foot, and with the men
came wives and children. They entered the state by way of
the Gila and the Colorado, the Sacramento, the Walker, the
Malheur and the Pit, and the Truckee. Some journeyed to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Mono region east of Yosemite and either struggled over difficult
Sonora Pass just north of the present park or tediously
made their way south to Owens River and then over Walker
Pass. The Sierra Nevada experienced a new period of exploration,
and California took a marked step toward the climax of
interest in her offerings.</p>
<p>This pre-Mexican War, pre-gold-rush immigration takes a
prominent place in the history of the state, and the tragedy
and success of its participants provide a story of engrossing interest.
They had forced their slow way across the continent
to find a permanent home beside the western sea, and their
arrival presaged the overthrow of Mexican rule in California.
The Mexican, Castro, stated before an assembly in Monterey:
&ldquo;These Americans are so contriving that some day they will
build ladders to touch the sky, and once in the heavens they
will change the whole face of the universe and even the color
of the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of the parties of settlers was a man of no signal traits,
who, by a chance discovery, was to set the whole world agog.
This was James W. Marshall, an employee of John A. Sutter
of the Sacramento. On January 24, 1848, he found gold in a
millrace belonging to Sutter. About a week later the inevitable
took place. California became a part of the United States.</p>
<p>The news of the gold discovery spread like wildfire, and by
the close of 1848 every settlement and city in America and
many cities of foreign lands were affected by the California
fever. Gold seekers swarmed into the newly acquired territory
by land and by sea. The overland routes of the fur trader and
the pioneer settler found such a use as the world had never
seen. From the Missouri frontier to Fort Laramie the procession
of Argonauts passed in an unbroken stream for months.
Some 35,000 people traversed the Western wilderness and 230
American vessels reached California ports in 1849. The western
slope of the Sierra from the San Joaquin on the south to
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
the Trinity on the north was suddenly populous with the gold-mad
horde. On May 29, the <i>Californian</i> of Yerba Buena issued
a notice to the effect that its further publication, for the present,
would cease because its employees and patrons were going
to the mines. On July 15 its editor returned and published an
account of his personal experiences as a gold seeker. He wrote:
&ldquo;The country from the Ajuba [Yuba] to the San Joaquin, a
distance of about 120 miles, and from the base toward the summit
of the mountains ... about seventy miles, has been explored
and gold found on every part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By 1849 the Mariposa hills were occupied by the miners,
and the claims to become famous as the &ldquo;Southern Mines&rdquo;
were being located. Jamestown, Sonora, Columbia, Murphys,
Chinese Camp, Big Oak Flat, Snelling, and Mariposa, all adjacent
to the Yosemite region, came to life in a day. Stockton
was the immediate base of supply for these camps.</p>
<p>The history of Mariposa is replete with fascinating episodes.
May Stanislas Corcoran, a daughter of Mariposa, has supplied
the Yosemite Museum with a manuscript entitled &ldquo;Mariposa,
the Land of Hidden Gold,&rdquo; which comes from her own accomplished
pen. From it the following brief account is abstracted
as an introduction to the beginnings of human affairs in the
Mariposa hills.</p>
<p>In 1850, Mariposa County occupied much of the state from
Tuolumne County southward. A State Senate Committee on
County Subdivision, headed by P. H. de la Guerra, determined
its bounds, and a Select Committee on Names, M. G. Vallejo,
Chairman, gave it its name&mdash;a name which was first applied by
Moraga&rsquo;s party in 1806 to Mariposa Creek.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> Gradually through
the years, the original expansive unit was reduced by the creation
of other counties&mdash;Madera, Fresno, Tulare, Kings, and
Kern, and parts of Inyo and Mono counties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Agua Fria was at first the county seat, but even in the beginning
the town of Mariposa was the center of the scene of activity.
Four mail routes of the Pony Express converged upon it.
Prior to the arrival of Americans, the Spanish Californians had
scarcely penetrated the Sierra in the county, but these uplands
were well populated with Indians. One of the strongest tribes,
the Ah-wah-nee-chees, lived in the Deep Grassy Valley (Yosemite)
during the summer months and occupied villages along the
Mariposa and Chowchilla rivers in the winter.</p>
<p>Mariposa proved to be the southernmost of the important
southern mines. Of the people who were drawn to it during
the days of the gold rush, many were from the Southern States.
They brought &ldquo;libraries ... horses from Kentucky ... silk hats,
chivalry, colonels, and culture from Virginia; and from most
of the states that later became Confederate, lawyers, doctors,
writers, even painters&mdash;miners all.... Pennsylvania, Massachusetts,
New York, and Europe also sent representatives, and
there were Mexican War veterans, such as Jarvis Streeter, Commodore
Stockton, Colonel Fremont, and Capt. Wm. Howard.&rdquo;
By Christmas, 1849, more than three thousand inhabitants
occupied the town of Mariposa, which extended from Chicken
Gulch to Mormon Bar.</p>
<p>In February, 1851, a remarkable vein of gold was discovered
in the Mariposa diggings, first designated as the &ldquo;Johnson vein
of Mariposa,&rdquo; and extensive works were developed from Ridley&rsquo;s
Ferry (Bagby) to Mount Ophir. These properties were
acquired by a company having headquarters in Paris, France,
which became known as &ldquo;The French Company.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The Fr&eacute;mont Grant, also known as the Rancho Las Mariposas,
was a vast estate of 44,386 acres of grazing land in the
Mariposa hills, which Colonel J. C. Fr&eacute;mont acquired by virtue
of a purchase made in 1847 from J. B. Alvarado. It was one
of several so-called &ldquo;floating grants.&rdquo; After gold was discovered
in the Mariposa region in 1848, Fr&eacute;mont &ldquo;floated&rdquo; his rancho
far from the original claim to cover mineral lands including
properties already in the possession of miners. The center of
Fr&eacute;mont&rsquo;s activities was Bear Valley, thirteen miles northwest
of Mariposa. Lengthy litigations in the face of hostile public
sentiment piled up court costs and lawyer fees. However, the
United States courts confirmed Fr&eacute;mont&rsquo;s claims, and other
claimants, including the French Company, lost many valuable
holdings. Tremendous investments were made in stamp mills,
tunnels, shafts, and the other appurtenances related to the mining
towns as well as to the mines which Fr&eacute;mont attempted
to develop.</p>
<p>In spite of its phenomenal but spotty productiveness, the
Fr&eacute;mont Grant brought bankruptcy to its owner and was
finally sold at sheriff sale. The town of Mariposa, which was
on Fr&eacute;mont&rsquo;s Rancho, became the county seat in 1854, and the
present court house was built that year. The seats and the bar
in the courtroom continue in use today, and the documents
and files of the mining days still claim their places in the ancient
vault. They constitute some of the priceless reminders
of a dramatic period in the early history of the Yosemite region.
In these records may be traced the transfer of the ownership of
the Mariposa Grant from Fr&eacute;mont to a group of Wall Street
capitalists. These new owners employed Frederick Law Olmsted
as superintendent of the estate. He arrived in the Sierra
in the fall of 1863 to assume his duties at Bear Valley. The
next year he was made chairman of the first board of Yosemite
Valley commissioners, so actively linking the history of the
Mariposa estate with the history of the Yosemite Grant. Olmsted
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
continued his connection with the Mariposa Grant until
Aug. 31, 1865, at which time he returned to New York and
proceeded to distinguish himself as the &ldquo;father&rdquo; of the profession
of landscape architecture.</p>
<p>His son, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., born July 24, 1870, has
continued in the Olmsted tradition. As an authority on parks,
municipal improvements, city planning and landscape architecture,
and the preservation of the American scene he has
exerted a leadership comparable to his father&rsquo;s pioneering.
He has entered the Yosemite picture as National Park Service
collaborator in planning and as a member of the Yosemite Advisory
Board, to which organization he was appointed in 1928.</p>
<p>One of the few members of the small army of early miners
in the Mariposa region who left a personal record of his experiences
was L. H. Bunnell. His writings provide most valuable
references on the history of the beginning of things in the
Yosemite region. He was present in the Mariposa hills in 1849,
and from his book, <i>Discovery of the Yosemite</i>, we learn that
Americans were scattered throughout the lower mountains in
that year. Adventurous traders had established trading posts in
the wilderness in order that they might reap a harvest from the
miners and Indians.</p>
<p>James D. Savage, the most conspicuous figure in early Yosemite
history, whose life story, if told in full, would constitute a
valuable contribution to Californiana, was one of these traders.
In 1849 he maintained a store at the mouth of the South Fork
of the Merced, only a few miles from the gates of Yosemite Valley.
Now half a million people each year hurry by this spot in
automobiles; yet no monument, no marker, no sign, indicates
that the site is one of the most significant, historically, of all
localities in the region. It was here that the first episode in the
drama of Yosemite Indian troubles took place. The story of
the white man&rsquo;s occupancy of the valley actually begins at the
mouth of this canyon in the Mariposa hills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><i>WHITE CHIEF OF THE FOOTHILLS</i></h2>
<p>The entire story of very early events in the Yosemite region
is pervaded by the spirit of one individual. In spite of the
fact that no historian has chronicled the events of his brief
but exciting career, the name of James D. Savage is legendary
throughout the region of the Southern Mines. It has been the
ambition of more than one writer of California history to pin
down the fables of this pioneer and to establish his true life
story on stable supports of authentic source. Scattered through
the literature of the gold days are sketchy accounts of his exploits,
and rarely narratives of firsthand experiences with his
affairs may be found. Before relating Savage definitely to Yosemite
itself we shall do well to consider his personal history.</p>
<p>During the beginning years of the gold excitement, his fame
spread throughout the camps and to the ports upon which the
mines depended for supplies. Savage was the subject of continual
gossip, conjecture, and acclaim. His career was short,
but it was crowded with thrilling happenings and terminated
with violence in a just cause. Throughout it, Savage was brave&mdash;a
man born to lead.</p>
<p>Because he played a leading role in the discovery of Yosemite
Valley, national park officials have been energetic in their attempt
to complete his life story and give it adequate representation
in the Yosemite Museum. For several years, as historical
material had been accumulating there, and details of most
events in the Yosemite drama unfolded and took their proper
place in the exhibits, Savage still remained a mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>At last there came a Yosemite visitor who was descended
from the grandfather of James D. Savage. This lady, Ida Savage
Bolles, after learning of the local interest in her relative, communicated
with yet another relative, who today resides in the
same Middle Western state from which &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; Savage came.
The result was that Mrs. Louise Savage Ireland took up the
challenge and devoted many months to the determining of the
California pioneer&rsquo;s ancestry. To her we acknowledge indebtedness
for her persevering search, which involved considerable
travel and correspondence. Not only did she reveal the ancestry
of Jim Savage, but she located a &ldquo;delightful old lady&rdquo; who, as
a girl, knew Jim of California fame. This unexpected biographical
material provides firsthand information about the
youth of James D. Savage such as has not been obtained from
any living Californian who knew him in his halcyon days.</p>
<p>The following story of the life of the first white man to enter
Yosemite Valley, though incomplete, is much more comprehensive
than anything that has previously appeared in print, and
is, we believe, gathered from sources<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> wholly dependable.</p>
<p>James D. Savage was one of six children born to Peter Savage
and Doritha Shaunce. Henry C. Pratt of Virginia, Illinois, a
second cousin, writes, &ldquo;My mother, Emily Savage, born in
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
1817, and her cousin, James Savage, were near the same age.&rdquo;
This is the best approximation of his age contained in the biographical
material accumulated by Mrs. Ireland. The parent,
Peter Savage, went by ox cart and raft from Cayuga County,
New York, to Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois, in 1822.
Sixteen years later Peter&rsquo;s family removed to Princeton, Bureau
County, Illinois.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ireland in her quest met Mrs. Sarah Seton Porter of
Princeton, who at the time of the interview in 1928 was ninety-eight
years old. Mrs. Porter knew James D. Savage as a youth.
She recalls that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jim Savage was grown when his father, Peter, brought the family
to Princeton from Morgan County. Jim was smart as a whip,
shrewd, apt in picking up languages, such as German and French&mdash;for
both tongues were spoken here, the two races having settlements
in and about Princeton. He was vigorous and strong, had blue eyes
and a magnificent physique, loved all kinds of sports engaged in
in his day, was tactful, likable, and interesting....</p>
<p>Sometimes Jim would come to church, but, oh, he was such a
wag of a youth. More often than not, he would remain outside, and
when he knew time had come for prayer, he&rsquo;d flick the knees of
his horse and make him kneel, too, and then wink at us inside. We
couldn&rsquo;t laugh of course, but we always watched for this trick of
Jim&rsquo;s. He got such a lot of fun out of doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Savage took a wife, Eliza, and settled in Peru, Illinois. A
daughter was born to this union. He and his brother, Morgan,
were caught in the wave of California fever that affected many
of the border settlements in the &rsquo;forties and they joined one
of the overland parties in 1846. Lydia Savage Healy, another
second cousin, expresses the opinion that the brothers joined
Fr&eacute;mont&rsquo;s third expedition. However, since it is known that
Savage&rsquo;s wife and child made the start, it is evident that they
were with one of the parties of emigrants who, that year, made
the journey. Mrs. Porter, then Sarah Seton, with two brothers
and a sister drove from Princeton to Peru to bid them farewell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>On this journey, &ldquo;suffering and discouragement went hand
in hand.&rdquo; The wife and child did not survive the trip. Only
the physically fit endured the hardships, and among these were
Savage and his brother. By what route they entered California
is not known, but S. P. Elias reports that Savage</p>
<blockquote>
<p>volunteered beneath the Bear flag and fought through the war
against the Mexicans. A member of Fr&eacute;mont&rsquo;s battalion, he was
with Fr&eacute;mont both in Oregon and in California. After peace and
before the discovery of gold, and shortly after the disbanding of
Fr&eacute;mont&rsquo;s battalion, he went to the south, settled among the Indians,
and through Jos&eacute; and J&eacute;sus, two of the most powerful chiefs
in the valley of the San Joaquin, he established an intimacy with
the principal tribes. By his indomitable energy, capability of endurance,
and personal prowess he acquired a complete mastery
over them to such an extent that he was elected chief of several of
the tribes. He obtained great influence over the Indians of the lowlands
and led them successfully against their mountain enemies,
conquering a peace wherever he forayed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any event, when Fr&eacute;mont and Pico put their signatures
to the Cahuenga peace treaty on January 13, 1847, the Mexican
War, so far as California was concerned, was at an end.
Fr&eacute;mont&rsquo;s battalion was disbanded, and we may believe, with
Elias, that James D. Savage then established his intimacy with
the principal Indian tribes of the San Joaquin.</p>
<p>His aptitude for &ldquo;picking up languages&rdquo; apparently came to
the fore, for he mastered the Indian dialect and extended his
influence until it amounted to something of a barbaric despotism.
The Indians acknowledged his authority, and he, no
doubt, improved their condition. In the wars with the mountain
tribes Savage&rsquo;s tactics won them victories, and he brought
about progress, generally.</p>
<p>Prior to the gold rush, his territory was seldom visited by
whites, but early in 1848, hardly a year subsequent to his
conquest of the Indians, there poured in that flood of miners
which transformed the entire picture. Savage adapted himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
to it forthwith, and soon his name was on the lips of everyone.
When he let it be known among his Indian followers that he
would like to acquire a lot of the yellow metal, the squaws set
to work and turned the product of their labors into the lap of
the white chief. W E. Wilde writes that Savage was associated
with the Rev. James Woods in 1848 and that he and his Indians
were working the gravel deposits at what became known as Big
Oak Flat. It was here that a white Texan stabbed Luturio, one
of the Indian leaders, and the Texan in turn was killed by the
Indians. Savage, knowing the potentialities of enraged Indians,
pacified them and withdrew with them to other localities.</p>
<p>George H. Tinkham next throws a spotlight on Savage at
Jamestown in May (?) 1849. Cornelius Sullivan related to Tinkham
that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>under a brushwood tent, supported by upright poles, sat James D.
Savage, measuring and pouring gold dust into the candle boxes by
his side. Five hundred or more naked Indians, with belts of cloth
bound around their waists or suspended from their heads brought
the dust to Savage, and in return for it received a bright piece of
cloth or some beads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just how much gold dust Savage acquired was never reported,
but that it was an enormous amount is not to be questioned.
For some two years his army of Indian followers busied
themselves in gleaning the creeks and ravines of the foothills,
and considering the facility with which gold could be gathered
it is small wonder that he was reputed to have barrels full of it.</p>
<p>We learn from L. H. Bunnell, one of Savage&rsquo;s intimate
acquaintances of long standing, that in 1849-1850 Savage had
established his trading post at the mouth of the South Fork of
the Merced, not more than fifteen miles below Yosemite Valley,
and on the line of the present Merced-Yosemite highway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point, engaged in gold mining, he had employed a party
of native Indians. Early in the season of 1850 his trading-post and
mining camp were attacked by a band of the Yosemite Indians. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
tribe, or band, claimed the territory in that vicinity, and attempted
to drive Savage off. Their real object, however, was plunder. They
were considered treacherous and dangerous, and were very troublesome
to the miners generally.</p>
<p>Savage and his Indian miners repulsed the attack and drove off
the marauders, but from this occurrence he no longer deemed this
location desirable. Being fully aware of the murderous propensities
of his assailants, he removed to Mariposa Creek, not far from the
junction of the Agua Fria, and near to the site of the old stone fort.
Soon after, he established a branch post on the Fresno, where the
mining prospects became most encouraging, as the high water subsided
in that stream. This branch station was placed in charge of a
man by the name of Greeley.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This event on the South Fork constitutes the initial step in
the hostilities that were to result in Savage&rsquo;s renown as the discoverer
of Yosemite Valley. Since he had remained so close to
the remarkable canyon for some months prior to the Indian
attack, and because the threatening Indians frequently boasted
of a &ldquo;deep valley in which one Indian is more than ten white
men,&rdquo; Bunnell once asked Savage whether he had ever entered
the mysterious place. Savage&rsquo;s words were: &ldquo;Last year while I
was located at the mouth of the South Fork of the Merced, I was
attacked by the Yosemites, but with the Indian miners I had
in my employ, drove them off, and followed some of them
up the Merced River into a canyon, which I supposed led to
their stronghold, as the Indians then with me said it was not
a safe place to go into. From the appearance of this rocky gorge
I had no difficulty in believing them. Fearing an ambush, I did
not follow them. It was on this account that I changed my location
to Mariposa Creek. I would like to get into the den of the
thieving murderers. If ever I have a chance I will smoke out
the Grizzly Bears [the Yosemites] from their holes, where they
are thought to be so secure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Savage built up an exceedingly prosperous business at his
trading posts on the Fresno and on Mariposa Creek. He stocked
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
his stores with merchandise from San Francisco Bay and exchanged
the goods at enormous profits for the gold brought in
by the Indians. An ounce of gold bought a can of oysters, five
pounds of flour, or a pound of bacon; a shirt required five
ounces, and a pair of boots or a hat brought a full pound of
the precious metal. His customers included white prospectors
as well as his subservient Indians, for the white men would
agree to his exacting terms in preference to leaving their diggings
to make a trip for supplies to the growing village of
Mariposa.</p>
<p>The Indians never questioned the rate of exchange, for to
them it seemed that their white chief was working miracles
in providing quantities of desirable food and prized raiment
in return for something that was to be had for the taking. To
guarantee a continuance of cordial relations with his Indian
friends, and to cement the alliance of several tribes, Savage had
taken wives from among the young squaws of different tribes.
Two of these were called Eekino and Homut. It is not known
which tribes were represented in his household, but the wives
are reported to have totaled five. If their bridal contract was
recognized by all their tribesmen, it is not difficult to understand
how Savage&rsquo;s supporters numbered five hundred.</p>
<p>The Mariposa Creek store retinue of whites was thrown
into a state of some agitation one fall day in 1850 when one
of Savage&rsquo;s wives confided the information that the mountain
Indians were combining to wipe the whites from the hills. Confirmation
of her rumor was obtained from some of the friendly
bucks who had long followed Savage. These Indians declared
that they had learned that the mountain tribe, the Yosemites,
were ready to descend upon Savage again for the purpose of
plunder and that they were maneuvering to secure the combined
forces of other tribes.</p>
<p>Savage did not misunderstand the threat, as did some others
of the white men. Hoping to impress the Indians with the wonders,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
numbers, and power of the whites, he conceived the idea
of taking some of them to that milling base of supply, San Francisco.
It is probable, too, that he planned to put some of his
great store of accumulated gold in safekeeping on the same
trip. Accordingly, he announced that he was going to &ldquo;the
Bay&rdquo; for a new stock of goods and invited Jos&eacute; Juarez, a chief
of influence with the Chowchillas and Chukchansies, to accompany
him. Jos&eacute; accepted the invitation. With them went
some of Savage&rsquo;s dependable Indian friends, including a wife
or two.</p>
<p>It was the occasion of this trip that provided the crowning
touch for Savage&rsquo;s reputation among the whites of all the gold
camps. The story of the affair spread to as many localities as
were represented in San Francisco&rsquo;s picturesque population at
the time of the visit, and legends of Jim Savage&rsquo;s barrel of gold
are handed down to this day. How large the barrel may have
been it is now impossible to ascertain, but certainly a fabulous
fortune traveled with the strange party.</p>
<p>They made their headquarters at the Revere House and
became the sensation of the hour.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> The Indians arrayed themselves
in gaudy finery and gorged themselves with costly viands
and considerable liquor. To the great distress of Savage, Jos&eacute;
maintained himself in a state of drunkenness throughout most
of their stay. In order to prevent disturbances Savage locked
him up on one occasion and when he was somewhat sobered
remonstrated with him. Jos&eacute; flew into an excited rage, became
abusive with his tongue, and finally disclosed his secret of the
war against the whites. Savage knocked him down.</p>
<p>The party remained to witness the celebration of the admission
of California into the Union on October 29, 1850. Savage
deposited his gold in exchange for goods to be delivered as
needed, gilded his already colorful visit with enough gambling
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
and reckless spending to stagger the residents, and gathered his
retinue for the return journey.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; had maintained a silence and dignity ever after the
violent quarrel with his chief.</p>
<p>No sooner had they reached the foothill territory from which
they had traveled a fortnight before than they were greeted
with news of Indian threats. As the Fresno station maintained
by Savage seemed to be in immediate danger, the party went
there at once. Numerous Indians were about, but all seemed
quiet. However, the white agents employed by Savage revealed
that the Indians were no longer trading.</p>
<p>Savage thereupon invited all Indians present to meet with
him and proceeded at once to conduct a peaceful confab before
his store. Addressing them he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that some of the Indians do not wish to be friends
with the white men and that they are trying to unite the different
tribes for the purpose of a war. It is better for the Indians
and white men to be friends. If the Indians make war on the
white men, every tribe will be exterminated; not one will be
left. I have just been where the white men are more numerous
than the wasps and ants; and if war is made and the Americans
are aroused to anger, every Indian engaged in the war will be
killed before the whites will be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having made himself clearly understood in the Indian language
he turned to his fellow traveler, Jos&eacute;, for confirmation of
his statements regarding the power of the whites. Jos&eacute; stepped
forward and delivered himself of the following brief but energetic
oration:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our brother has told his Indian relatives much that is truth;
we have seen many people; the white men are very numerous;
but the white men we saw on our visit are of many tribes; they
are not like the tribe that dig gold in the mountains.&rdquo; He then
gave an absurd description of what he had seen while below,
and continued: &ldquo;Those white tribes will not come to the mountains.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
They will not help the gold diggers if the Indians make
war against them. If the gold diggers go to the white tribes in
the big village, they give their gold for strong water and games;
when they have no more gold, the white tribes drive the gold
diggers back to the mountains with clubs. They strike them
down [referring to the police], as your white relative struck
me while I was with him. The white tribes will not go to war
with the Indians in the mountains. They cannot bring their
big ships and big guns to us; we have no cause to fear them.
They will not injure us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His climax came as a bold argument for the immediate declaration
of war upon the whites.</p>
<p>Chief Jos&eacute; Rey of the Chowchillas then contributed his plea
for immediate hostilities, and Savage withdrew before the two
hostile chiefs. Upon his return to the Mariposa Station, his
appeals for immediate preparation for war were given small
hearing by the whites. A few were inclined to scoff.</p>
<p>Close on the heels of the warnings, however, came news of an
attack on the Fresno store. All the whites except the messenger
who had brought the news were killed. The Mariposa Indian
War was on.</p>
<p>Savage had gone to Horse Shoe Bend in the Merced Canyon
to solicit aid. He had hoped to find a more attentive audience
there than among the county officials at Agua Fria. In his absence
his Mariposa store was burned, its three white attendants
were killed, and his wives were carried off by the assailants.</p>
<p>Cassady, one of the rival traders who had scoffed at Savage&rsquo;s
first news of impending disaster, was surprised in his establishment
and met quick death. Three other murderous attacks
took place in the immediate vicinity, and the whites finally
leaped to the defense of their holdings.</p>
<p>James Burney, the county sheriff, took a place at the head of
a body of volunteers who had banded for mutual protection.
On January 6, 1851, James D. Savage accompanied this party
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
in an attack made upon an Indian encampment of several hundred
squaws and bucks under the leadership of Jos&eacute; Rey. This
was the first organized movement of the whites against the
Indians of the Mariposa Hills.</p>
<p>By this time Governor McDougal had issued a proclamation
calling for volunteers, and the Mariposa Battalion came into
existence. Savage was made major in full command. Three
companies, under John J. Kuykendall, John Boling, and William
Dill, were organized and drilled near Savage&rsquo;s ruined
Mariposa store.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> The affairs of this punitive body of men are
dealt with in another chapter. Let it here suffice to say that its
activities were especially directed against the mountain tribe
of &ldquo;Grizzlies,&rdquo; and that on March 25, 1851, Savage and his men
entered the mysterious stronghold, Yosemite Valley.</p>
<p>In 1928 it was my privilege to interview Maria Lebrado, one
of the last members of the Yosemite tribe who experienced
subjection by the whites. I eagerly sought ethnological and
historical data, which was forthcoming in gratifying abundance.
Purposely I had avoided questioning the aged squaw
about Major Savage; but presently she asked, in jumbled English
and Spanish, if I knew about the &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; of the white
soldiers. She called him &ldquo;Chowwis,&rdquo; and described him as a
blond chief whose light hair fell upon his shoulders and whose
beard hung halfway to his waist. She had been much impressed
by his commanding blue eyes and declared that his shirts were
always red. To this member of the mountain tribe of Yosemite
the Major was recalled as something of a thorn in her flesh.
That he was a beloved leader of the foothill tribes she agreed,
but hastened to explain that those Indians, too, were enemies
of her people. Maria is the only person I have met who had
seen Savage.</p>
<p>For five months Savage commanded the movements of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Mariposa Battalion. Its various units were active in the Sierra
Summit region above Yosemite, at the headwaters of the Chowchilla,
and on the upper reaches of the San Joaquin. In every
encounter the Indians were defeated and they finally sued for
peace. The prowess of Savage as a mountaineer and military
leader is borne out in a letter, published in <i>Alta California</i>
on June 12, 1851, in which the battalion&rsquo;s sergeant major describes
at length for the adjutant a foray at the headwaters of
the San Joaquin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... I am aware that you have been high up and deep in the mountains
and snow yourself, but I believe this trip ranks all others. The
Major himself has seen ca&ntilde;ons and snow peaks this trip which he
never saw before. It is astonishing what this man can endure. Traveling
on day and night, through snow and over the mountains,
without food, is not considered fatigue to him, and as you are well
aware the boys will follow him as long as he leaves a sign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same <i>Alta</i> carries a resolution, signed by men in Dill&rsquo;s and
Boling&rsquo;s companies, affirming in great detail their high confidence
in Savage.</p>
<p>In addition to his activities with the battalion in the field,
Major Savage functioned conspicuously in aiding the United
States Indian Commissioners in preparing a peace treaty. He
maintained a friendly attitude toward the oppressed Indians
and, had the government made good its promises, or had the
appropriations not been absorbed elsewhere, the tribes of the
Sierra would have been more adequately provided for. The
treaty, signed April 29, 1851, does not carry the &ldquo;signatures&rdquo; of
Tenaya of the Yosemites or of the leader of the Chowchillas.</p>
<p>On July 1, 1851, the Mariposa Battalion was mustered out.
Major Savage resumed his trading operations in a store on the
Fresno River near Coarse Gold. In compliance with the treaty,
a reservation for the Indians was set aside on the Fresno, and
another on the Kings River. In the fall of 1851 the Fresno store
was the polling place for a large number of voters for county
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
officers. That winter Savage built Fort Bishop, near the Fresno
reservation, and prepared to carry on a prosperous trade. He
spoke as follows on this subject to L. H. Bunnell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I can make good my losses by the Indians <i>out</i> of the Indians,
I am going to do it. I was the best friend the Indians had, and they
would have destroyed me. Now that they once more call me &ldquo;Chief,&rdquo;
they shall build me up. I will be just to them, as I have been merciful,
for, after all, they are but poor ignorant beings, but my losses
must be made good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the first months of 1852, Major Savage conducted a
substantial, if not a phenomenal, business with the miners of
the Fresno and surrounding territory, and with the Indians
at the agency. No Indian hostilities were in evidence, but a
policy of excluding them from the store proper was adhered
to. The goods which they bought with their gold dust were
handed out to them through small openings left in the walls.
These openings were securely fastened at night.</p>
<p>Not infrequently the Indians were subjected to abusive
treatment at the hands of certain whites. The mistreatment
was enough to provoke an uprising, but with a few exceptions
they remained on the reservations. An important light on subsequent
events in Savage&rsquo;s life is brought out in this statement
by L. H. Bunnell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as I was able to learn at the time, a few persons envied
them the possession of their Kings River reservation and determined
to &ldquo;squat&rdquo; upon it, after they should have been driven
off. This &ldquo;border element&rdquo; was made use of by an unprincipled
schemer, who it was understood was willing to accept office, when
a division of Mariposa County should have been made, or when a
vacancy of any kind should occur. But population was required, and
the best lands had been reserved for the savages. A few hangers-on,
at the agencies, that had been discharged for want of employment
and other reasons, made claims upon the Kings River reservation;
the Indians came to warn them off, when they were at once fired
upon, and it was reported that several were killed.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Further details of the deplorable act committed by the
would-be &ldquo;squatters&rdquo; are provided by the following news item
which appeared in the <i>Alta California</i> of July 7, 1852:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Anticipated Indian Difficulties on King&rsquo;s River</span></p>
<p>By Mr. Stelle, who came express to Stockton on the 5th inst., we
have received the annexed correspondence from</p>
<p><span class="lr">San Joaquin, (Evening,) July 2, 1852.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Editors Alta California</span>:&mdash;A few days ago, the Indians on King&rsquo;s
River warned Campbell, Poole &amp; Co., ferrymen, twenty miles from
here, to leave, showing at the same time their papers from the Indian
Commissioners. The Indians then left, and threatened to kill
the ferrymen if on their reservation when they returned. Mr. Campbell
has been collecting volunteers, many have joined him. Major
Harvey left this evening with some eighteen or twenty men. A fine
chance for the boys to have a frolic, locate some land, and be well
paid by Uncle Sam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These agitations and murders were denounced by Major
Savage in unsparing terms. Although the citizens of Mariposa
were at the time unable to learn the details of the affair at Kings
River, which was a distant settlement, the great mass of the
people were satisfied that wrong had been done to the Indians;
however, there had been a decided opposition by citizens generally
to the establishment of two agencies in the county, and
the selection of the best agricultural lands for reservations.
Mariposa then included nearly the whole San Joaquin Valley
south of the Tuolumne.</p>
<p>The opponents to the recommendations of the commissioners
claimed that &ldquo;The government of the United States has
no right to select the territory of a sovereign State to establish
reservations for the Indians, nor for any other purpose, without
the consent of the State!&rdquo; The state legislature of 1851-1852
instructed the senators and representatives in congress to use
their influence to have the Indians removed beyond the limits
of the state.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>W. W. Elliott, in his <i>History of Fresno County</i> (1881), reveals
further details: &ldquo;Sometime previous to August 16, 1852,
one Major Harvey, the first county Judge of Tulare County,
and Wm. J. Campbell, either hired or incited a lot of men,
who rushed into one of the rancherias on Kings River and succeeded
in killing a number of old squaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elliott&rsquo;s assertions are supported by the following news item
from the <i>San Francisco Daily Herald</i>, August 21, 1852:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among other acts by white men calculated to excite the Indians,
a ferry was established over the San Joaquin, within an Indian
reservation, above Fort Miller, some miles above Savage&rsquo;s. The
Indians, no doubt, considered this an encroachment; and from
an idea that the ferry stopped fish from ascending the river, some
straggling Indian, acting without authority from chiefs or council,
spoke of this notion about the fish at the ferry, and saying that the
ferry was within their lands, added that it would have to be broken
up. The proprietor of the ferry, assuming this as a threatened hostility,
or making a pretence of it, assembled a few willing friends,
who, armed with rifles, appeared suddenly among some Indian
families while most of the men were many miles off, peaceably at
work at Savage&rsquo;s, without dreaming of danger, and without justifiable
provocation the white men fired upon the families, killing
two women, as it is stated, and some children, and wounding several
others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With such conditions prevailing on the Kings, it is small
wonder that numerous Kings Agency Indians traveled to the
Fresno in order to trade with Savage. Needless to say, this
aroused the further ire of the traders on the Kings. The white
malcontents continued their agitation, and the wronged Indians
of the Kings wailed to Savage of their troubles. Consistently
with his earlier acts, wherein the public good was
involved, Major Savage attempted to pacify the Indians. He
also denounced the &ldquo;squatters&rdquo; with all the emphasis of his
personality and high standing. He asserted that they should
be punished under the laws which they had violated and presented
the case to the Indian Commissioners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Harvey and the trader Campbell made common cause of
denouncing Major Savage in return. Word was sent to the
Major that they dared him to set foot in Kings River region.
Upon its receipt, Savage mounted his horse and traveled to the
Kings River Agency.</p>
<p>The events that occurred upon his arrival have been variously
described by half a dozen writers. Elliott&rsquo;s description,
which agrees essentially with Bunnell&rsquo;s, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the 16th day of August, 1852, Savage paid a visit to the Kings
River Reservation, but previously to this Harvey declared that if
Savage ever came there he would not return alive. Arriving at the
reservation early in the forenoon, Savage found there Harvey and
Judge Marvin, and a quarrel at once ensued between Savage and
Harvey, the latter demanding of Savage a retraction of the language
he had used regarding Harvey, whereupon Savage slapped
Harvey across the face with his open hand, and while doing so, his
pistol fell out of his shirt bosom and was picked up by Marvin.
Harvey then stepped up to Marvin and said: &ldquo;Marvin you have
disarmed me; you have my pistol.&rdquo; &ldquo;No&rdquo; said Marvin, &ldquo;this is Major
Savage&rsquo;s pistol,&rdquo; whereupon Harvey, finding Savage unarmed, commenced
firing his own pistol, shooting five balls into Savage, who
fell, and died almost instantly. Marvin was standing by all this
time, with Savage&rsquo;s pistol in his hands, too cowardly or scared to
interfere and prevent the murder. At this time Harvey was County
Judge of Tulare County, and one Joel H. Brooks, who had been
in the employment of Savage for several years, and who had received
at his hands nothing but kindness and favors, was appointed
by Harvey, Justice of the Peace, for the sole purpose of investigating
Harvey&rsquo;s case for the killing of Savage. Of course Harvey was
acquitted by Brooks&mdash;was not even held to answer before the Grand
Jury. Harvey finally left, in mortal fear of the Indians, for he imagined
that every Indian was seeking his life to avenge the murder of
Savage. Afterwards, Harvey died of paralysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1926 the late Boutwell Dunlap unearthed 169 pages of
depositions in manuscript form, taken in a law case of 1858 in
which the death of Savage was made an issue. The incidents
related by the witness under oath are redolent of the old wild
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
days. This testimony comes from the same Brooks who as magistrate
had acquitted Harvey. It is quoted as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twenty-four hours after the Indians had ordered Campbell to
leave, Harvey and his company had a fight with the Indians, killing
some and whipping the balance. Savage was then an Indian agent
appointed by Wozencroft. Savage and Wozencroft made a great fuss
about the American people abusing the Indians and succeeded in
getting the Commanding General of the U.S. forces on the Pacific
to send up a couple of companies of troops to Tulare County, to
take up Major Harvey and the men that were under his command
and that had assisted him in this horrible murder of &ldquo;the poor innocent
savages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The circumstances which led to Savage&rsquo;s death grew out of this
difficulty. The troops had crossed Kings River. This was some time
in August 1852 in the morning. Major Savage and Judge John G.
Marvin rode up to the door of Campbell&rsquo;s trading-house. Savage
called for Harvey. Harvey stepped to the door. Savage remarked,
&ldquo;I understand, Major Harvey, that you say I am no gentleman.&rdquo;
Harvey replies, &ldquo;I have frequently made that statement.&rdquo; Savage
remarked, to Harvey, &ldquo;There is a good horse, saddle, bridle, spurs
and leggings which belong to me. I fetched them, for the purpose
of letting you have them to leave this country with.&rdquo; Harvey replied,
&ldquo;I have got a fine mule and I will leave the country on my
own animal, when I want to leave it.&rdquo; Savage called for breakfast.
Savage and Marvin ate breakfast by themselves in a brush house
outside the store. After they had got through their breakfast, Savage
tied up his hair, rolled up his sleeves, took his six-shooter out of
its scabbard and placed it in front of him under the waistband of
his pantaloons. He then walked into Campbell&rsquo;s store and asked
Major Harvey if he could not induce him to call him a gentleman.
Harvey told him that he had made up his mind and had expressed
his opinion in regard to that, and did not think he would alter it.
He knocked Harvey down and stamped upon him a little. They
were separated by some gentlemen in the house, and Harvey got
up. Savage says, &ldquo;To what conclusion have you come in regard to
my gentlemancy?&rdquo; Harvey replies, &ldquo;I think you are a damned scoundrel.&rdquo;
Savage knocked Harvey down again. They were again separated
by gentlemen present. As Harvey straightened himself onto
his feet, he presented a six-shooter and shot Major Savage through
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
the heart. Savage fell without saying anything. It was supposed that
Harvey shot him twice after he was dead, every ball taking effect
in his heart. That is all I know about the fight. I gained this information
by taking the testimony as magistrate of those who saw it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What may have become of the court records of the so-called
trial is unknown, but a scrap of testimony by the proprietor
of the house in which the killing took place was preserved by
the <i>San Francisco Daily Herald</i>, September 3, 1852, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="revint">The People of the State of California <i>vs.</i> Walter H. Harvey, for the
killing of James D. Savage, on the 16th day of August, 1852, contrary
to the laws of the State of California, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Mr. Edmunds sworn, says&mdash;&ldquo;Yesterday morning Major Savage
came into my house and asked Major Harvey if he had said he was
no gentleman. Major Harvey replied he had said it. Major Savage
struck Major Harvey on the side of the head and knocked him
down on some sacks of flour, and then proceeded to kick and beat
him. Judge Marvin and some one else interfered, and Major Savage
was taken off of Major Harvey. Major Savage still had hold of
Major Harvey when Major Harvey kicked him. Major Savage then
struck Major Harvey on the cheek, and knocked him down the second
time, and used him, the same as before. By some means I cannot
say, Major Savage was again taken off, and they separated.
Major Savage was in the act of attacking him again, when Major
Harvey draw his pistol and shot him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Question by the Court</i>&mdash;Did Major Harvey shoot more than
once?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>&mdash;I think he did; I found four holes in him.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>&mdash;Did Major Savage knock Major Harvey down before
he drew his pistol?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>&mdash;The prisoner had been knocked down by Major Savage
twice before he drew his pistol, or made any attempt to shoot him.</p>
<p>Mr. Gonele sworn&mdash;corroborates the evidence of Mr. Edmunds.
Mr. Knider sworn, also does the same.</p>
<p>This is all the testimony given in as to the fight, Major Fitzgerald,
U.S.A., sworn, testified to some facts which induced him to think
Major Savage not a gentleman.</p>
<p>The Court, upon this testimony, discharged Major Harvey without
requiring bail.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>So passed the leading figure in early Yosemite history. In this
day of greater appreciation of individual heroism, sacrifice,
and pioneer accomplishment in public service, how one covets
unprejudiced narratives of such lives as was that of James D.
Savage! Bunnell comments feelingly on &ldquo;his many noble qualities,
his manly courage, his generous hospitality, his unyielding
devotion to friends, and his kindness to immigrant strangers.&rdquo;
A writer in the <i>Daily Herald</i> of September 4, 1852, contributes
more details of events that followed the murder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Effect of Major Savage&rsquo;s Death upon the Indians</span></p>
<p>We have received a letter dated August 31st. on the Indian Reservation,
Upper San Joaquin, giving some further particulars of the
murder of Major James Savage and the effect produced thereby
upon the Indians. The writer has resided among them upwards
of two years, understood their language and their habits, and for
a long time assisted Major Savage in managing them. His opinions
therefore are entitled to weight. The following extracts will show
the probable effect this murder will have on the prospects of the
southern section of the State:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have doubtless ere this heard of the death, or rather murder,
of Major Savage upon King&rsquo;s River. It has produced considerable
sensation throughout the country and is deeply regretted, for the
country and the government have lost the services of a man whom it
will not be easy to replace. He could do more to keep the Indians in
subjection than all the forces that Uncle Sam could send here. The
Indians were terribly excited at his death. Some of them reached
the scene of the tragedy soon after it occurred. They threw themselves
upon his body, uttering the most terrific cries, bathing their
hands and faces in his blood, and even stooping and drinking it, as
it gushed from his wounds. It was with difficulty his remains could
be interred. The Chiefs clung to his body, and swore they would
die with their father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night he was buried the Indians built large fires, around
which they danced, singing the while the mournful death chaunt,
until the hills around rang with the sound. I have never seen such
profound manifestations of grief. The young men, as they whirled
wildly and distractedly around in the dance, shouted the name of
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
their &lsquo;father&rsquo; that was gone; while the squaws sat rocking their
bodies to and fro, chaunting their mournful dirges, until the very
blood within one curdled with horror at the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the slightest doubt that there will be a general outbreak
this winter. Just as soon as the rainy season sets in we shall
have the beginning of one of the most protracted and expensive
wars the people of California have ever been engaged in. The
Indians are quiet now, but are evidently contemplating some hostile
movement. They told me, a few days since, that their &lsquo;father&rsquo;
was gone and they would not live with the whites any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have studied the character of these Indians, as you know, for
more than two years, and have acquired my experience in managing
them under Savage himself. I do not speak lightly nor unadvisedly,
therefore, when I assert that no more disastrous event could
have occurred to the interests of this State, than the murder of the
gallant Major Savage.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible that more details of Savage&rsquo;s biography may be
brought to light, and it is with that hope, coupled with the desire
to give his memory just due, that this material is presented
for public perusal.</p>
<p>On the Fresno River, near the site of his old trading post,
rest the bones of the &ldquo;white chief.&rdquo; In 1855, Dr. Leach, who had
been associated with Savage in trading with the Indians, journeyed
to the Kings River, disinterred the remains, and transferred
them to their present resting place. A ten-foot shaft of
Connecticut granite, bearing the simple inscription, &ldquo;Maj.
Jas. D. Savage,&rdquo; marks the spot. On July 4, 1929, the little city
of Madera, California, honored the memory of Savage by placing
an inscribed plaque on a city gate. These memorials, presumably,
are the only public reminders of the importance of
James D. Savage in the history of the state.</p>
<p>The story of Major Savage may be concluded with a reference
to his family ties. As has been related, Californians were,
until 1928, wholly mystified about his origin. Through the
researches of Louise Savage Ireland we are made to sense the
human side of his saga and are brought to an understanding
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
of his intimate family connections and his faithfulness to blood
ties. L. H. Savage of El Paso, Texas, writes that his father, John
W. Savage, first cousin of James D. Savage, made a vain attempt
to join the Major in California. Returning miners in 1850 told
the Illinois Savages that &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; invited them to come to California,
where he would make them rich. John, then a boy
of nineteen years, financed by older members of the family,
shipped for the Golden State and sailed around the Horn.
Almost a year elapsed before he reached San Francisco.
There he learned that his noted relative had met death six
months before.</p>
<p>What became of any wealth that the Major may have amassed
remains a mystery. The Indians he struggled to protect and the
lands he tried to save for them long ago passed out of the reckoning.
By way of explanation we quote from Hutchings&rsquo; <i>In
the Heart of the Sierras</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reservation on the Fresno gradually became unpopular on
this account [because the Indians craved their mountain homes],
but mainly from bad management; was afterwards abolished by
the Government; and, finally, its lands and buildings were gobbled
up by sharp-sighted, if not unprincipled men, who, like many
others of that class, became rich out of the acquisition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One cannot but wonder what counteracting influences James
D. Savage would have exercised in the Fresno Agency business
had he been permitted to live.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><i>PIONEERS IN THE VALLEY</i></h2>
<p>By March of 1851 the Indian Commissioners McKee, Barbour,
and Woozencraft were actively assembling representatives
of the numerous Sierra Indian tribes and driving
sharp bargains with them to quitclaim their lands. On March
19, 1851, the commissioners in their camp (Camp Fr&eacute;mont)
in the Mariposa region reached an agreement with six tribes
and proceeded to establish a reservation for them. Their report
refers to one tribe, the &ldquo;Yosemetos,&rdquo; who were expected at this
confab but failed to appear. The friendly Indians who signed
the treaty reported that this mountain tribe had no intentions
of coming in. It was, therefore, decided to send Major Savage
and a part of his Mariposa Battalion after them.</p>
<p>On the evening of March 19, the day on which the Camp
Fr&eacute;mont treaty was signed, Major Savage set out with the
companies of Captains Boling and Dill. Captain Kuykendall&rsquo;s
company had traveled to the region of the San Joaquin and
Kings rivers, in which locality the commissioners planned to
negotiate another treaty. The force under the command of
Major Savage followed a route very near that which is now
known as the Wawona Road to Yosemite Valley.</p>
<p>On the South Fork of the Merced, at what is now called
Wawona, a Nuchu camp was surprised and captured. Messengers
sent ahead from this camp returned with the assurance
that the Yosemite tribe would come in and give themselves up.
Old Chief Tenaya of the Yosemites did come into camp, but,
after waiting three days for the others, Major Savage became
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
impatient and set out with the battalion to enter the much-talked-of
Yosemite retreat. When they had covered about half
the distance to the valley, seventy-two Indians were met plodding
through the snow. Not convinced that this band constituted
the entire tribe, Savage sent them to his camp on the
South Fork while he pushed on to the valley. His route again
was that followed by the present Wawona road.</p>
<p>On March 25, 1851, the party went into camp near Bridalveil
Fall. That night around the campfire a suitable name for
the remarkable valley was discussed. Lafayette H. Bunnell, a
young man upon whom the surroundings and events had made
a deeper impression than upon any of the others, urged that
it be named Yosemite, after the natives who had been driven
out. This name was agreed upon. Although the whites knew
the name of the tribe, they were apparently unaware that the
Indians had another name, Ahwahnee, for their Deep Grassy
Valley.</p>
<p>The next morning the camp was moved to the mouth of
Indian Canyon, and the day was spent in exploring the valley.
Only one Indian was found, an ancient squaw, too feeble to
escape. Parties penetrated Tenaya Canyon above Mirror Lake,
ascended the Merced Canyon beyond Nevada Fall, and explored
both to the north and to the south of the river on the
valley floor. No more Indians were discovered, and on the third
day the party withdrew from the valley. The Indians who had
been gathered while the party was on the way to the valley
escaped from their guard while en route to the Indian Commissioner&rsquo;s
camp on the Fresno; so this first expedition accomplished
nothing in the way of subduing the Yosemites.</p>
<p>In May, 1851, Major Savage sent Captain John Boling and
his company back to Yosemite to surprise the elusive inhabitants
and to whip them well. Boling followed the same route
taken previously and arrived in Yosemite on May 9. He made
his first camp near the site of the present Sentinel Bridge. Chief
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Tenaya and a few of his followers were captured, but the majority
of the Yosemites eluded their pursuers. It was during this
stay in Yosemite that the first letter from the valley was dispatched.
On May 15, 1851, Captain Boling wrote to Major
Savage of his affairs, and the letter was published in the <i>Alta
California</i>, June 12, 1851. It follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On reaching this valley, which we did on the 9th inst., I selected
for our encampment the most secluded place that I could
find, lest our arrival might be discovered by the Indians. Spies were
immediately despatched in different directions, some of which
crossed the river to examine for signs on the opposite side. Trails
were soon found, leading up and down the river, which had been
made since the last rain. On the morning of the 10th we took up
the line of march for the upper end of the valley, and having traveled
about five miles we discovered five Indians running up the
river on the north side. All of my command, except a sufficient
number to take care of the pack animals, put spurs to their animals,
swam the river and caught them before they could get into
the mountains. One of them proved to be the son of the old Yosemety
chief. I informed them if they would come down from the
mountains and go with me to the U. S. Indian Commissioners, they
would not be hurt; but if they would not, I would remain in their
neighborhood as long as there was a fresh track to be found; informing
him at the same time that all the Indians except his father&rsquo;s
people and the Chouchillas had treated.... He then informed me
that ... if I would let him loose, with another Indian, he would
bring in his father and all his people by twelve o&rsquo;clock the next day.
I then gave them plenty to eat and started him and his companion
out. We watched the others close, intending to hold them as
hostages until the despatch-bearers returned. They appeared well
satisfied and we were not suspicious of them, in consequence of
which one of them escaped. We commenced searching for him,
which alarmed the other two still in custody, and they attempted
to make their escape. The boys took after them and finding they
could not catch them, fired and killed them both. This circumstance,
connected with the fact of the two whom we had sent out
not returning, satisfied me that they had no intention of coming in.
My command then set out to search for the Rancheria. The party
which went up the left toward Can-yarthia [?] found the rancheria
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
at the head of a little valley, and from the signs it appeared that
the Indians had left but a few minutes. The boys pursued them up
the mountain on the north side of the river, and when they had
got near the top, helping each other from rock to rock on account
of the abruptness of the mountains; the first intimation they had
of the Indians being near was a shower of huge rocks which came
tumbling down the mountain, threatening instant destruction. Several
of the men were knocked down, and some of them rolled and
fell some distance before they could recover, wounding and bruising
them generally. One man&rsquo;s gun was knocked out of his hand
and fell seventy feet before it stopped, whilst another man&rsquo;s hat was
knocked off his head without hurting him. The men immediately
took shelter behind large rocks, from which they could get an occasional
shot, which soon forced the Indians to retreat, and by pressing
them close they caught the old Yo-semity chief, whom we yet
hold as a prisoner. In this skirmish they killed one Indian and
wounded several others.</p>
<p>You are aware that I know this old fellow well enough to look
out well for him, lest by some stratagem he makes his escape. I shall
aim to use him to the best advantage in pursuing his people. I send
down a few of my command with the pack animals for provisions;
and I am satisfied if you will send me ten or twelve of old Ponwatchez&rsquo;
best men I could catch the women and children and
thereby force the men to come in. The Indians I have with me have
acted in good faith and agree with me in this opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On May 21, some members of the invading party discovered
the fresh trail of a small party of Indians traveling in the direction
of the Mono country. Immediate pursuit was made, and on
May 22 the Yosemites were discovered encamped on the shores
of Tenaya Lake in a spot much of which was snow-covered.
They were completely surprised and surrendered without a
struggle. This was the first expedition made into the Yosemite
high country from the west, and it was on this occasion that
the name Lake Tenaya was applied by Bunnell. The old Indian
chief, on being told of how his name was to be perpetuated,
sullenly remonstrated that the lake already had a name, &ldquo;Py-we-ack&rdquo;&mdash;Lake
of the Shining Rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The Indians were on this second occasion successfully escorted
to the Fresno reservation. Tenaya and his band, however,
refused to adapt themselves to the conditions under which
they were forced to live. They begged repeatedly to be permitted
to return to the mountains and to the acorn food of their
ancestors. At last, on his solemn promise to behave, Tenaya
was permitted to go back to Yosemite with members of his
family. In a short time his old followers quietly slipped away
from the reservation and joined him. No attempt was made
to bring them back.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1851-52, no complaints against the
Yosemites were registered, but in May of 1852 a party of eight
prospectors made their way into the valley, where two of
them were killed by the Indians. A remarkable manuscript,
prepared by Stephen F. Grover, a member of this party, was
obtained by Mrs. A. E. Chandler, of Santa Cruz, who in 1901
mailed it to Galen Clark. Upon Clark&rsquo;s death it was turned
over to the pioneer Yosemite photographer, George Fiske.
When Mr. Fiske died, the papers were given to National Park
Service officials for safekeeping in the Yosemite Museum.
Grover&rsquo;s reminiscences are apparently authentically presented
and divulge much that was not recorded elsewhere. Those
familiar with Yosemite history as it has been accepted since the
appearance of Bunnell&rsquo;s <i>Discovery of Yosemite</i> will recognize a
number of incidents that are at variance with previous records.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Grover&rsquo;s Narrative&mdash;A Reminiscence</span></p>
<p>On the 27th of April, 1852, a party of miners, consisting of Messrs.
Grover, Babcock, Peabody, Tudor, Sherburn, Rose, Aich, and an
Englishman whose name I cannot now recall, left Coarse Gold
Gulch in Mariposa County, on an expedition prospecting for gold
in the wilds of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We followed up
Coarse Gold Gulch into the Sierras, traveling five days, and took
the Indian trail through the Mariposa Big Tree Grove, and were
the first white men to enter there. Then we followed the South Fork
of the Merced River, traveling on Indian trails the entire time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>On reaching the hills above Yosemite Valley, our party camped
for the night, and questioned the expediency of descending into
the Valley at all. Our party were all opposed to the project except
Sherburn, Tudor, and Rose. They over-persuaded the rest and
fairly forced us against our will, and we finally followed the old
Mariposa Indian trail on the morning of the 2nd of May, and entering
the Valley on the East side of the Merced River, camped on
a little opening, near a bend in the River free from any brush
whatever, and staked out our pack mules by the river. I, being the
youngest of the party, a mere boy of twenty-two years, and not feeling
usually well that morning, remained in camp with Aich and
the Englishman to prepare dinner, while the others went up the
Valley, some prospecting, and others hunting for game. We had
no fear of the Indians, as they had been peaceable, and no outbreaks
having occurred, the whites traveled fearlessly wherever they
wished to go. Thus, we had no apprehension of trouble. To my
astonishment and horror I heard our men attacked, and amid
firing, screams, and confusion, here came Peabody, who reached
camp first, wounded by an arrow in his arm and another in the
back of his neck, and one through his clothes, just grazing the skin
of his stomach, wetting his rifle and ammunition in crossing the
river as he ran to reach camp. Babcock soon followed, and as both
men had plunged through the stream that flows from the Bridal
Veil Falls in making their escape, they were drenched to the skin.</p>
<p>On reaching us, Aich immediately began picking the wet powder
from Babcock&rsquo;s rifle, while I with my rifle stood guard and kept
the savages at bay the best I could. (The other men, with the exception
of Sherburn, Tudor, and Rose, came rushing into camp in wild
excitement.) Rose, a Frenchman, was the first to fall, and from the
opposite side of the stream where he fell, apparently with his death
wound, he screamed to us, &ldquo;&rsquo;T is no use to try to save ourselves, we
have all got to die.&rdquo; He was the only one of our company that could
speak Indian and we depended upon him for an interpreter. Sherburn
and Tudor were killed in their first encounter, Tudor being
killed with an ax in the hands of a savage, which was taken along
with the party for cutting wood. The Indians gathered around as
near as they dared to come, whooping and yelling, and constantly
firing arrows at us. We feared they would pick up the rifles dropped
by our companions in their flight and turn them against us, but
they did not know how to use them. As we were very hard pressed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
and as the number of Indians steadily increased, we tried to escape
by the old Mariposa trail, the one by which we entered the Valley,
one of our number catching up a sack of a few pounds of flour and
another a tin cup and some of our outer clothing and fled as best
we could with the savages in hot pursuit. We had proceeded but
a short distance when we were attacked in front by the savages who
had cut off our retreat. Death staring at us on almost every hand,
and seeing no means of escape, we fled to the bluff, I losing my pistol
as I ran. We were in a shower of arrows all the while, and the Indians
were closing in upon us very fast; the valley seemed alive with
them&mdash;on rocks, and behind trees, bristling like Demons, shrieking
their war whoops, and exulting in our apparently easy capture.
We fired back at them to keep them off while we tried to make our
way forward hugging the bluff as closely as possible. Our way was
soon blocked by the Indians who headed us off with a shower of
arrows (two going through my clothing, one through my hat which
I lost), when from above the rocks began to fall on us and in our
despair we clung to the face of the bluff, and scrambling up we
found a little place in the turn of the wall, a shelf-like projection,
where, after infinite labor, we succeeded in gathering ourselves,
secure from the falling rocks, at least, which were being thrown
by Indians under the orders from their Chief. The arrows still
whistled among us thick and fast, and I fully believe&mdash;could I visit
that spot even now after the lapse of all these years&mdash;I could still
pick up some of those flint arrow points in the shelf of the rock and
in the face of the bluff where we were huddled together.</p>
<p>We could see the old Chief Tenieya way up in the Valley in an
open space with fully one hundred and fifty Indians around him,
to whom he gave his orders, which were passed to another Chief
just below us, and these two directed those around them and
shouted orders to those on the top of the bluff who were rolling
the rocks over on us. Fully believing ourselves doomed men, we
never relaxed our vigilance, but with the two rifles we still kept
them at bay, determined to sell our lives as dearly as possible. I
recall, with wonder, how every event of my life up to that time
passed through my mind, incident after incident, with lightning
rapidity, and with wonderful precision.</p>
<p>We were crowded together beneath this little projecting rock
(two rifles were fortunately retained in our little party, one in the
hands of Aich and one in my own), every nerve strung to its highest
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
tension, and being wounded myself with an arrow through my
sleeve that cut my arm and another through my hat, when all of a
sudden the Chief just below us, about fifty yards distant, suddenly
threw up his hands and with a terrible yell fell over backwards
with a bullet through his body. Immediately, the firing of arrows
ceased and the savages were thrown into confusion, while notes of
alarm were sounded and answered far up the Valley and from the
high bluffs above us. They began to withdraw and we could hear
the twigs crackle as they crept away.</p>
<p>It was now getting dusk and we had been since early morning
without food or rest. Not knowing what to expect we remained
where we were, suffering from our wounds and tortured with fear
till the moon went down about midnight; then trembling in every
limb, we ventured to creep forth, not daring to attempt the old
trail again; we crept along and around the course of the bluff and
worked our way up through the snow, from point to point, often
feeling the utter impossibility of climbing farther, but with an
energy born of despair, we would try again, helping the wounded
more helpless than ourselves, and by daylight we reached the top
of the bluff. A wonderful hope of escape animated us though surrounded
as we were, and we could but realize how small our chances
were for evading the savages who were sure to be sent on our trail.
Having had nothing to eat since the morning before, we breakfasted
by stirring some of our flour in the tip cup, with snow, and
passing it around among us, in full sight of the smoke of the Indian
camps and signal fires all over the Valley.</p>
<p>Our feelings toward the &ldquo;Noble Red Man&rdquo; at this time can better
be imagined than described.</p>
<p>Starting out warily and carefully, expecting at every step to feel
the stings of the whizzing arrows of our deadly foes, we kept near
and in the most dense underbrush, creeping slowly and painfully
along as best we could, those who were best able carrying the extra
garments of the wounded and helping them along; fully realizing
the probability of the arrow tips with which we were wounded
having been dipped in poison before being sent on their message
of death. In this manner we toiled on, a suffering and saddened
band of once hopeful prospectors.</p>
<p>Suddenly a deer bounded in sight. Some objected to our shooting
as the report of our rifle might betray us&mdash;but said I, as well die by
our foes as by starvation, and dropping on one knee with never a
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
steadier nerve or truer aim, the first crack of my rifle brought him
down. Hope revived in our hearts, and quickly skinning our prize
we roasted pieces of venison on long sticks thrust in the flame and
smoke, and with no seasoning whatever it was the sweetest morsel I
ever tasted. Hastily stripping the flesh from the hind quarters of the
deer, Aich and myself, being the only ones able to carry the extra
burden, shouldered the meat and we again took up our line of
travel. In this manner we toiled on and crossed the Mariposa Trail,
and passed down the south fork of the Merced River, constantly
fearing pursuit. As night came on we prepared camp by cutting
crotched stakes which we drove in the ground and putting a pole
across enclosed it with brush, making a pretty secure hiding place
for the night; we crept under and lay close together. Although
expecting an attack we were so exhausted and tired that we soon
slept.</p>
<p>An incident of the night occurs to me: One of the men on reaching
out his foot quickly, struck one of the poles, and down came the
whole structure upon us. Thinking that our foes were upon us, our
frightened crowd sprang out and made for the more dense brush,
but as quiet followed we realized our mistake and gathering together
again we passed the remainder of the night in sleepless
apprehension.</p>
<p>When morning came we started again, following up the river,
and passed one of our camping places. We traveled as far as we
could in that direction, and prepared for our next night to camp
and slept in a big hollow tree, still fearing pursuit. We passed the
night undisturbed and in the morning started again on our journey,
keeping in the shelter of the brush, and crossed the foot of the
Falls, a little above Crane Flat&mdash;so named by us, as one of our party
shot a large crane there while going over, but it is now known as
Wawona. We still traveled in the back ground, passing through
Big Tree Grove again, but not until we gained the ridge above
Chowchilla did we feel any surety of ever seeing our friends again.</p>
<p>Traveling on thus for five days, we at last reached Coarse Gold
Gulch once more, barefooted and ragged but more glad than I
can express. An excited crowd soon gathered around us and while
listening to our hair-breadth escapes, our sufferings and perils, and
while vowing vengeance on the treacherous savages, an Indian was
seen quickly coming down the mountain trail, gaily dressed in war
paint and feathers, evidently a spy on our track, and not three
hours behind us. A party of miners watched him as he passed by
the settlement. E. Whitney Grover, my brother, and a German
cautiously followed him. The haughty Red Man was made to bite
the dust before many minutes had passed.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>My brother Whitney Grover quickly formed a company of
twenty-five men, who were piloted by Aich, and started for the
Valley to bury our unfortunate companions. They found only Sherburn
and Tudor, after a five days march, and met with no hostility
from the Indians. They buried them where they lay, with such land
marks as were at hand at that time. I have often called to mind the
fact that the two men, Sherburn and Tudor, the only ones of our
party who were killed on that eventful morning, were seen reading
their Bibles while in camp the morning before starting into the Valley.
They were both good men and we mourned their loss sincerely.</p>
<p>After we had been home six days, Rose, who was a partner of
Sherburn and Tudor in a mine about five miles west of Coarse Gold
Gulch, where there was a small mining camp, appeared in the
neighborhood and reported the attack and said the whole party was
killed, and that he alone escaped. On being questioned, he said he
hid behind the Waterfall and lived by chewing the leather strap
which held his rifle across his shoulders. This sounded strange to us
as he had his rifle and plenty of ammunition and game was abundant.
Afterward hearing of our return to Coarse Gold Gulch camp,
he never came to see us as would have been natural, but shortly
disappeared. We thought his actions and words very strange and
we remembered how he urged us to enter the Valley, and at the
time of the attack was the first one to fall, right amongst the savages,
apparently with his death wound, and now he appears without a
scratch, telling his version of the affair and disappearing without
seeing any of us. We all believed he was not the honest man and
friend we took him to be. He took possession of the gold mine in
which he held a one-third interest with Sherburn and Tudor, and
sold it.</p>
<p>Years afterward, in traveling at a distance and amongst strangers,
I heard this story of our adventures repeated, as told by Aich, and
he represented himself as the only man of the party who was not
in the least frightened. I told them that &ldquo;I was most thoroughly
frightened, and Aich looked just as I felt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Santa Cruz, California</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The commander of the regular army garrison at Fort Miller
was notified of these events, and a detachment of the 2d Infantry
under Lieutenant Tredwell Moore was dispatched in
June, 1852. Five Indians were captured in the Yosemite Valley,
all of whom were found to possess articles of clothing belonging
to the murdered men. These Indians were summarily shot.
Tenaya&rsquo;s scouts undoubtedly witnessed this prompt pronouncement
of judgment, and the members of the tribe fled with all
speed to their Piute allies at Mono Lake.</p>
<p>The soldiers pursued the fleeing Indians by way of Tenaya
Lake and Bloody Canyon. They found no trace of the Yosemites
and could elicit no information from the Piutes. The party
explored the region north and south of Bloody Canyon and
found some promising mineral deposits. In August they returned
to Tuolumne Soda Springs and then made their way
back to Mariposa by way of the old Mono Trail that passed
south of Yosemite Valley.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Mariposa they exhibited samples of their
ore discoveries. This created the usual excitement, and Lee
Vining with a party of companions hastened to visit the region
to prospect for gold. Leevining Canyon, through which the
Tioga Road now passes, was named for the leader of this party.</p>
<p>Tenaya and his refugee band remained with the Mono Indians
until late in the summer of 1853, when they again ventured
into their old haunts in the Yosemite Valley. Shortly after
they had re&euml;stablished themselves in their old home, a party
of young Yosemites made a raid on the camp of their former
hosts and stole a band of horses which the Monos had recently
driven up from southern California. The thieves brought the
animals to Yosemite by a very roundabout route through a pass
at the head of the San Joaquin, hoping by this means to escape
detection. However, the Monos at once discovered the ruse and
organized a war party to wreak vengeance upon their ungrateful
guests. Surprising the Yosemites while they were feasting
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
gluttonously upon the stolen horses, they almost annihilated
Tenaya&rsquo;s band with stones before a rally could be effected.
Eight of the Yosemite braves escaped the slaughter and fled
down the Merced Canyon. The old men and women who
escaped death were given their liberty, but the young women
and children were made captive and taken to Mono Lake.</p>
<p>The story of this last act in the elimination of the troublesome
Yosemites was made known to Bunnell by surviving members
of the tribe.</p>
<p>In 1928, when I talked with Maria, a member of the original
Yosemite tribe, her version of the massacre differed widely
from the story told by Bunnell. Through her daughter she
stoutly assured me that no Indians died in Yosemite Valley
except those killed by whites and those who were ill. I asked
her how Tenaya died and where. She explained that while the
Yosemites were at Mono Lake they engaged in hand games
with the Monos. These games are stirring affairs among the
Indians. A. L. Kroeber states, &ldquo;It is impossible to have seen
a California Indian warmed to his work in this game when
played for stakes&mdash;provided its aim and method are understood&mdash;and
any longer justly to designate him mentally sluggish
and emotionally apathetic, as is the wont. It is a game
in which not sticks and luck, but the tensest of wills, the keenest
perceptions and the supplest of muscular responses are
matched.... Seen in this light, the contortions, gesticulations,
noises, and excitement of the native are not the mere uncontrolledness
of an overgrown child, but the outward reflexes of
a powerfully surcharged intensity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Maria, it was in the heat of such a game that
a quarrel developed between Tenaya and his Mono allies. In
the fight that followed, Tenaya and five of his Yosemite braves
were stoned to death. At least, this stoning feature agrees with
former accounts of the killing. Horse stealing and a gluttonous
feast in Yosemite Valley do not figure in Maria&rsquo;s story. She insists
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
that Tom &ldquo;Hutchings,&rdquo; the Yosemite Indian befriended
by J. M. Hutchings, attended to the burning of the bodies and
packed the charred remains upon his own back from Mono
Lake to Hites Cove. There a great &ldquo;cry&rdquo; was held for two
weeks; the remaining Yosemite Indians and all their friends
bewailed the loss of Chief Tenaya and the four tribesmen.</p>
<p>A number of parties of miners, emboldened by the news of
the disbanding of the Yosemites, visited the valley in the fall
of 1853. During 1854 no white men are known to have entered
Yosemite Valley.</p>
<p>By 1855 several accounts written by members of the three
punitive expeditions that had entered Yosemite had been published
in San Francisco papers. The difficulties of overcoming
hostile Indians in the search for gold were far more prominent
in the minds of these writers than the scenic wonders of the
new-found valley. Nevertheless, the mention of a thousand-foot
waterfall in one of these published letters awakened James
M. Hutchings, then publishing the <i>California Magazine</i>, to
the possibilities that Yosemite presented. Hutchings organized
the first tourist party in June, 1855, and with two of the original
Yosemites as guides proceeded from Mariposa over the old
Indian trail via Wawona and Inspiration Point to the valley.
Thomas Ayres, an artist, was a member of the party and during
this visit he made the first sketches ever made in Yosemite. Ten
of these original pencil drawings are now preserved in the
Yosemite Museum.</p>
<p>In 1853, James Alden, then a commander in the United
States Navy, came to California on a commission to settle the
boundary between Mexico and California. He remained until
1860. Some time between 1856 and 1860 he visited Yosemite
Valley. Probably on his return to San Francisco he came upon
Ayres&rsquo;s work, which appealed to him as the best mementos
of his Yosemite experience, and he procured ten originals and
one lithograph. Mrs. Ernest W. Bowditch, Mrs. C. W. Hubbard,
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
and Mrs. A. H. Eustis, descendants of Admiral Alden and
heirs to these priceless drawings, have presented them to the
Yosemite Museum, which stands near the spot where some of
them were made.</p>
<p>In the years that have elapsed since these drawings were
created, they have journeyed on pack mules, sailed the seas in
old United States men-of-war, jolted about in covered wagons,
and at last made a transcontinental journey to come again to
the valley that gave them birth.</p>

<p>Hutchings and his first sight-seers &ldquo;spent five glorious days
in luxurious scenic banqueting&rdquo; in the newly discovered
valley and then followed their Indian guides over the
return trail to Mariposa. Upon their arrival in that mountain
city, they were besieged with eager questioners, among whom
was L. A. Holmes, the editor of the <i>Mariposa Gazette</i>, which
had recently been established. Mr. Holmes begged that his
paper be given opportunity to publish the first account from
the pen of Mr. Hutchings. His request was complied with, and
in the <i>Gazette</i> of July 12, 1855, appears the first printed description
of Yosemite Valley, prepared by one uninfluenced by
Indian troubles or gold fever.</p>
<p>Journalists the country over copied the description, and
so started the Hutchings Yosemite publicity, which was to
continue through a period of forty-seven years. Parties from
Mariposa and other mining camps, and from San Francisco,
interested by Hutchings&rsquo; oral and printed accounts, organized,
secured the same Indian guides, and inaugurated tourist travel
to the Yosemite wonder spot.</p>
<p>Milton and Houston Mann, who had accompanied one of
these sight-seeing expeditions, were so imbued with the possibilities
of serving the hordes of visitors soon to come that they
set to work immediately to construct a horse toll trail from
the South Fork of the Merced to the Yosemite Valley. Galen
Clark, who also had been a member of one of the 1855 parties,
was prompted to establish a camp on the South Fork where
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
travelers could be accommodated. This camp was situated on
the Mann Brothers&rsquo; Trail and later became known as Clark&rsquo;s
Station. It is known as Wawona now. The Mann brothers finished
their trail in 1856.</p>
<p>Old Indian trails were followed by much of the Mariposa-Yosemite
Valley route. The toll was collected at White and
Hatch&rsquo;s, approximately twelve miles from Mariposa. At Clark&rsquo;s
Station (Wawona), the trail detached itself from the Indian
route and ascended Alder Creek to its headwaters. Here it
crossed to the Bridalveil Creek drainage and passed through
several fine meadows, gradually ascending to the highest point
on the route above Old Inspiration Point on the south rim of
Yosemite Valley. From this point it dropped sharply to the floor
of the valley near the foot of Bridalveil Fall. The present-day
Alder Creek and Pohono trails traverse much of the old route.</p>
<p>Several years after the pioneer trail was built, sheep camps
were established on two of the lush meadows through which
it passed. They were known as Westfall&rsquo;s and Ostrander&rsquo;s. The
rough shelters existing here were frequently used by tired
travelers who preferred to make an overnight stop on the
trail rather than exhaust themselves in completing the saddle
trip to the valley in one day. Usually, however, Westfall&rsquo;s or
Ostrander&rsquo;s were convenient lunch stops for the saddle parties.</p>
<p>In 1869, Charles Peregoy built a hotel, &ldquo;The Mountain View
House,&rdquo; at what had been known as Westfall Meadow and with
the help of his wife operated a much-praised hospice every
summer until 1875, when the coming of the stage road between
Wawona and Yosemite Valley did away with the greater part of
the travel on the trail.</p>
<p>The Mann Brothers&rsquo; Trail, which was some fifty miles in
length, was purchased by Mariposa County and made available
to public use without charge before construction of the stage
road from Mariposa had been completed.</p>
<p>In 1856, the year that witnessed the completion of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
Mariposa-Yosemite Valley Trail, L. H. Bunnell, George W.
Coulter, and others united in the construction of the &ldquo;Coulterville
Free Trail.&rdquo; Very little, if any, of this route followed existing
Indian trails. The Coulterville Trail started at Bull Creek,
to which point a wagon road already had been constructed, and
passed through Deer Flat, Hazel Green, Crane Flat, and Tamarack
Flat to the point now known as Gentry, and thence to the
valley. Its total length was forty-eight miles, of which seventeen
miles could be traveled in a carriage.</p>
<p>A second pioneer horse trail on the north side of the Merced
began at the village of Big Oak Flat, six miles north of Coulterville,
and followed a route north of the Coulterville Free Trail
through Garrote to Harden&rsquo;s Ranch on the South Fork of the
Tuolumne River, thence to its junction with the Coulterville
Trail between Crane Flat and Tamarack Flat.</p>
<p>Sections of all of these early routes passed over high terrain
where deep snow persisted well into the spring. Early fall snow
storms in these vicinities sometimes contributed to the hazards
of travel. The trails found use during a relatively short season.
The Merced Canyon offered opportunity to establish a route at
lower elevation, but the difficulties of construction in the narrow
gorge deterred all would-be builders until a short time
prior to the wagon-road era. The Hite&rsquo;s Cove route, which came
into use in the early &rsquo;seventies, partly answered the need for
a snow-free canyon trail. Hite&rsquo;s Cove, where the John Hite
Mine was located in 1861, is on the South Fork of the Merced
some distance above its confluence with the Merced River. A
wagon road eighteen miles in length made it accessible from
Mariposa. Tourists using this route stopped overnight in Hite&rsquo;s
Cove and then traveled twenty miles in the saddle up the Merced
Canyon to the valley.</p>
<p>Another means of reaching the valley on horseback via the
Merced Canyon was developed soon after wagon roads had
been built. Some Yosemite visitors, perhaps because of the poor
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
condition of the roads at certain seasons, elected to leave the
Coulterville stage route at Dudley&rsquo;s, from where they went to
Jenkins Hill on the rim of the steep walls of the Merced gorge.
Here a horse trail enabled them to descend to the bottom of
the canyon, thence up the Merced to the valley. This thirty-mile
saddle trip involved an overnight stop at Hennesey&rsquo;s, situated
a short distance below the present El Portal.</p>
<p>Travel in the saddle, of course, was regarded by the California
pioneer with few qualms. Likewise, the conveyance of
freight on the backs of mules was looked upon as commonplace,
and the success attained by those early packers is, in this
day and age, wonderful to contemplate. In Hutchings&rsquo; <i>California
Magazine</i> for December, 1859, appears a most interesting
essay on the business of packing as then practiced among the
mountaineers of the gold camps.</p>
<p>Pack animals and packers have not yet passed from the
Yosemite scene, for much of the back country is, and always
will be, we hope, accessible by trail only. Government trail
gangs are dependent for weeks at a time upon the supplies
brought to them upon the backs of mules. Likewise, those who
avail themselves of High Sierra Camp facilities are served by
pack trains. Present-day packing differs in no essential way
from the mode of the &rsquo;fifties, except that it is often done by
Indians instead of the old-time Mexican <i>mulatero</i>.</p>
<p>What one visitor of the pre-wagon days thought of the saddle
trip into Yosemite Valley may be gathered from J. H. Beadle
in his <i>Undeveloped West</i>. Beadle visited the Sierra in 1871 and
approached the valley from the north.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thirty-seven miles from Garrote bring us to Tamarack Flat,
the highest point on the road, the end of staging, and no wonder.
The remaining five miles down into the valley must be made on
horseback.</p>
<p>While transferring baggage&mdash;very little is allowed&mdash;to pack mules,
the guide and driver amuse us with accounts of former tourists,
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
particularly of Anna Dickinson, who rode astride into the valley,
and thereby demonstrated her right to vote, drink &ldquo;cocktails,&rdquo; bear
arms, and work the roads, without regard to age, sex, or previous
condition of servitude. They tell us with great glee of Olive Logan,
who, when told she must ride thus into the valley, tried practising
on the back of the coach seats, and when laughed at for her pains,
took her revenge by savagely abusing everything on the road. When
Mrs. Cady Stanton was here a few weeks since, she found it impossible
to fit herself to the saddle, averring she had not been in one
for thirty years. Our accomplished guide, Mr. F. A. Brightman,
saddled seven different mules for her (she admits the fact in her
report), and still she would not risk it, and &ldquo;while the guides
laughed behind their horses, and even the mules winked knowingly
and shook their long ears comically, still she stood a spectacle for
men and donkeys.&rdquo; In vain the skillful Brightman assured her he
had piloted five thousand persons down that fearful incline, and
not an accident. She would not be persuaded, and walked the entire
distance, equal to twenty miles on level ground. And shall this
much-enduring woman still be denied a voice in the government
of the country? Perish the thought. With all these anecdotes I
began to feel nervous myself, for I am but an indifferent rider, and
when I observed the careful strapping and saw that my horse was
enveloped in a perfect network of girths, cruppers and circingles,
I inquired diffidently, &ldquo;Is there no danger that this horse will turn
a somerset with me over some steep point?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; rejoined
the cheerful Brightman, &ldquo;he is bitterly opposed to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We turn again to the left into a sort of stairway in the mountain
side, and cautiously tread the stony defile downward; at places over
loose boulders, at others around or over the points of shelving rock,
where one false step would send horse and rider a mangled mass
two thousand feet below, and more rarely over ground covered
with bushes and grade moderate enough to afford a brief rest. It
is impossible to repress fear. Every nerve is tense; the muscles involuntarily
make ready for a spring, and even the bravest lean
timorously toward the mountain side and away from the cliff, with
foot loose in stirrup and eye alert, ready for a spring in case of peril.
The thought is vain; should the horse go, the rider would infallibly
go with him. And the poor brutes seem to fully realize their danger
and ours, as with wary steps and tremulous ears, emitting almost
human signs, with more than brute caution they deliberately place
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
one foot before the other, calculating seemingly at each step the desperate
chances and intensely conscious of our mutual peril. Mutual
danger creates mutual sympathy&mdash;everything animal, everything
that can feel pain, is naturally cowardly&mdash;and while we feel a strange
animal kinship with our horses, they seem to express a half-human
earnestness to assure us that their interest is our interest, and their
self-preservative instinct in full accord with our intellectual dread.
We learn with wonder that of all the five thousand who have made
this perilous passage not one has been injured&mdash;if injured be the
word, for the only injury here would be certain death. One false
step and we are gone bounding over rocks, ricocheting from cliffs,
till all semblance of humanity is lost upon the flat rock below. Such
a route would be impossible to any but those mountain-trained
mustangs, to whom a broken stone staircase seems as safe as an ordinary
macadamized road.</p>
<p>At length we reach a point where the most hardy generally dismount
and walk&mdash;two hundred feet descent in five hundred feet
progress. Indeed half the route will average the descent of an ordinary
staircase. Then comes a passage of only moderate descent and
terror, then another and more terrible stairway&mdash;a descent of four
hundred feet in a thousand. I will not walk before and lead my
horse, as does our guide, but trail my long rope halter and keep him
before,&mdash;always careful to keep on the upper side of him, springing
from rock to rock, and hugging the cliff with all the ardor of a
young lover. For now I am scared. All pretense of pride is gone,
and just the last thing I intend to risk is for that horse to stumble,
and in falling strike me over that fearful cliff. At last comes a
gentler slope, then a crystal spring, dense grove and grass-covered
plat, and we are down into the valley. Gladly we take the stage, and
are whirled along in the gathering twilight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vehicle that whirled Beadle over the flat of the valley
floor was brought to Yosemite before roads were constructed
and is now exhibited at the Yosemite Museum as &ldquo;the first
wagon in Yosemite Valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrival of visitors prompted the building of shelters.
The first habitation to be constructed by white men in Yosemite
was a rough shack put up in 1855 by a party of surveyors,
of which Bunnell was a member. A company had been organized
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
to bring water from the foot of the valley into the dry
diggings of the Mariposa estate. It was supposed that a claim
in the valley would doubly secure the water privileges.</p>
<p>The first permanent structure was built in 1856 by Walworth
and Hite. It was constructed of pine boards that were
rived out by hand, and occupied the site of the 1851 camp of
Boling&rsquo;s party (near the foot of the present Four-Mile Trail to
Glacier Point). It was known as the Lower Hotel until 1869,
when it was pulled down, and Black&rsquo;s Hotel was constructed
on the spot.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1857, Beardsley and Hite put up a canvas-covered
house in the old village. The next year this was replaced
by a wooden structure, the planks for which had been
whipsawed by hand. J. M. Hutchings was again in the valley
in 1859, and his <i>California Magazine</i> for December of that
year tells of the first photographs to be made in Yosemite.
C. L. Weed, a pioneer photographer apparently working for
R. H. Vance, packed a great instrument and its bulky equipment
through the mountains to the Yosemite scenes. Photography
was just then taking its place in American life. Mr.
Weed&rsquo;s first Yosemite subject was this Upper Hotel of Beardsley
and Hite. Hutchings and Weed decided on this occasion
that they must visit the fall now called Illilouette, and Hutchings
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reader would have laughed could he have seen us ready for
the start. Mr. Beardsley, who had volunteered to carry the camera,
had it inverted and strapped at his back, when it looked more
like an Italian &ldquo;hurdy gurdy&rdquo; than a photographic instrument, and
he like the &ldquo;grinder.&rdquo; Another carried the stereoscopic instrument
and the lunch; another, the plate-holders and gun, etcetera; and
as the bushes had previously somewhat damaged our broadcloth
unmentionables, we presented a very queer and picturesque appearance
truly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hutchings published a woodcut made from the first photograph
of the Yosemite hostelry in November of 1859; his book,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
<i>In the Heart of the Sierras</i>, again alludes to his presence in
the valley when this first photograph was taken. Naturally,
students of California history have been interested in learning
more about the work of Weed, but in spite of serious attempts
to procure more information on this photographer of 1859,
nothing was brought to light. It was then something of a thrill
to me to find myself in possession of an original print from the
earliest Yosemite negative. That the print is genuine seems to
be a fact, and the incidents relative to its discovery are worth
the telling here.</p>
<p>Its donor, Arthur Rosenblatt, resided as a small boy within
a few blocks of the Hutchings San Francisco home on Pine
Street. Mr. Rosenblatt and his brothers played with the Hutchings
children. In 1880 the Hutchings home was destroyed by
fire. The small boys of the neighborhood searched the debris
for objects worth saving, and Irving and Wallace Rosenblatt
salvaged a pack of large water-stained photographs. Arthur
Rosenblatt with forethought mounted these pictures in an old
scrapbook. He has cherished them through the years that have
passed. In June, 1929, he visited the Yosemite Museum and
was interested in the historical exhibits. In his study of the
displayed materials, he came upon a photographic copy of the
old drawing of the &ldquo;Hutchings House,&rdquo; which has been taken
from <i>In the Heart of the Sierras</i>. He recognized its subject as
identical with one of the old photographs which he had preserved
since 1880. He made his find known to the park naturalist,
and immediately phoned to his San Francisco home and
requested that the scrapbook be mailed at once to the Yosemite
Museum. Upon its receipt, the old hotel photograph was segregated
from the others, and comparisons were made with the
drawing in the old Hutchings book and with the building
itself. The print is obviously from the original Weed negative.</p>
<p>Hutchings&rsquo; visit of 1859 apparently convinced him of the
desirability of residing in Yosemite Valley. During the next few
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
years he spared no effort in making its wonders known to the
world through his <i>California Magazine</i>. The spirited etchings
of Yosemite wonders that were reproduced in the magazine
from Weed&rsquo;s photos and from Ayres&rsquo;s drawings did much to
convince travelers of the magnificence of Yosemite scenery.
The stream of tourists who entered the valley grew apace in
spite of the hardships to be endured on the long journey in
the saddle. Horace Greeley was one of those who braved the
discomforts in 1859 and gave his description of the place to
hundreds of thousands in the East. Greeley, foolishly, determined
to make the 57-mile saddle trip via the Mariposa route
in one day. He arrived at the Upper Hotel in Yosemite Valley
at 1:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, more dead than alive, yet shortly afterward he
wrote, &ldquo;I know no single wonder of Nature on earth which can
claim a superiority over the Yosemite.&rdquo; His visit was made at
a season when Yosemite Falls contained but little water, and
he dubbed them a &ldquo;humbug,&rdquo; but his hearty praise of the general
wonders played a significant part in turning the interest
of Easterners upon the new mecca of scenic beauty.</p>
<p>In 1864 J. M. Hutchings came to the Upper Hotel (Cedar
Cottage) in the role of proprietor. The mirth and discomfiture
engendered among Hutchings&rsquo; guests by the cheesecloth partitions
between bedrooms prompted him to build a sawmill
near the foot of Yosemite Falls in order to produce sufficient
lumber to &ldquo;hard finish&rdquo; his hostelry. It was in this mill that
John Muir found employment for a time. The hotel was
embellished with lean-tos and porches, and an addition was
constructed at the rear in which was completely enclosed the
trunk of a large growing cedar tree. Hutchings built a great
fireplace in this sitting room and proceeded to make the novel
gathering place famous as the &ldquo;Big Tree Room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A winter spent in the frigid shade of the south wall of Yosemite
Valley convinced the Hutchings family that their &ldquo;Big Tree
Room&rdquo; was not a pleasant winter habitation. They built anew
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
and moved into the warm sunshine of the north side of the valley.
With their own hands members of the family constructed
a snug cabin among giant black oaks near the foot of Yosemite
Falls and there spent the remainder of their Yosemite days.</p>
<p>Papers, letters, and photographs relating to the Yosemite
experiences of the Hutchings family have been preserved by
J. M. Hutchings&rsquo; daughter, Mrs. Gertrude Hutchings Mills,
and by the family of his wife, the Walkingtons of England.
Materials generously donated from these sources take important
places in the collections of the Yosemite Museum and have
greatly aided in the preparation of this volume.</p>
<p>J. M. Hutchings invested heavily in the construction of the
Sentinel group of buildings and continued to be identified
with the Yosemite as publicity agent, hotel proprietor, resident,
official guardian, and unofficial champion until 1902. In that
year, he met his death on the zigzags of the Big Oak Flat Road.
In the 1902 register of the hotel, which was once the Hutchings
House, is the following entry made by Mrs. Hutchings, the
second wife of J. M. Hutchings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">November 8, 1902</span></p>
<p>Today leaving Yo Semite and all I love best.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Emily A. Hutchings</span></span></p>
<p>Thinking that some who come here may wish to know a little
about the sad tragedy of Mr. J. Hutchings&rsquo; death, I would like to
write a few words.</p>
<p>Because I had never seen Yo Semite in the autumn, my dear
husband brought me here for a short holiday, on our way to San
Francisco. We started from the Calaveras Big Trees and came via
Parrots Ferry, and its beautiful gorge&mdash;the wonderful old mining
center of Columbia, and its hitherto only surface-skimmed Gold
Fields&mdash;Sonora and its good approaches, in its oiled and well graded
roads&mdash;and thence to Chaffee and Chamberlains and to Crockers
and their hearty hospitality. It has been a very pleasant experience,
to see many friends on the way&mdash;most of them honored &ldquo;Old
Timers,&rdquo; who have been the thews and sinews of the State, and who
still hold their own in the rugged strength, which has brought them
through to 1902.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>From Crockers, we started on the last day of our journey [Oct. 31,
1902], continuing through the glorious Forests of the Sierras, the
autumnal tints of which this year, have been of unusual grandeur&mdash;these
beauties all being intensified in Yo Semite.</p>
<p>Coming down the Grade we were impressed beyond expression,
and, when we reached the point where El Capitan first presents
itself, my Husband said, &ldquo;It is like Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no apparent danger near but one of the horses took
fright (probably a wild animal was at hand) and dashed away.
When the Angel of Death reached Mr. Hutchings a few moments
later&mdash;under the massive towering heights of that sun-illumined
Cliff&mdash;&ldquo;He&rdquo; found him in the full vigour of life and high energetic
purpose&mdash;but his grief-stricken wife prayed in vain that the ebbing
tide would stay.</p>
<p>From the moment the sad accident was known, the greatest sympathy
and kindness were shown, loving hands gave reverent aid&mdash;and
on Sunday, Nov. 2, 1902, my dear husband was borne from the
Big Tree Room and its time honored memories. The residents of
the Valley and many of the Indians, who had long known him, followed.
We laid him to rest, surrounded by nature in Her most
glorious garb, and under the peaks and domes he had loved so well
and had explored so fearlessly.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Emily A. Hutchings</span></span></p>
<p>Nov. 8, 1902</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1941 and for several years thereafter, Yosemite Valley was
visited by Cosie Hutchings Mills, daughter of J. M. Hutchings,
born October 5, 1867, the second white child born in the valley.
Elizabeth H. Godfrey, of the Yosemite Museum, obtained
from Mrs. Mills both written and oral statements regarding
the pioneer experiences of the Hutchings family in Yosemite.
The interviews with Mrs. Mills were recorded by Mrs. Godfrey.
Her manuscript, &ldquo;Chronicles of Cosie Hutchings Mills,&rdquo;
and Mrs. Mills&rsquo; written reminiscences are preserved in the
Yosemite Museum.</p>

<br /><i>STAGECOACH DAYS</i></h2>
<p>For twenty-three years after the coming of the first sightseers,
Yosemite Valley was accessible only by horse trail.
The twelve thousand tourists, who frantically clung to their
Yosemite-bound steeds during this period, included many Easterners
and Europeans not accustomed to mountain trails. They
had departed surcharged with enthusiasm but sometimes were
caustic in their expressions regarding their mode of conveyance
and the crudity of the facilities found at their disposal both
en route and in the valley. Not a few of the comments made
by visitors found their way into print. Yosemite bibliography
is not limited to items printed in English. The entire world
sent representatives to the valley during that first period of
travel, and foreign literature carried the story of Yosemite wonders
quite as did American publications. The reader may form
some opinion of what the printed word has done for Yosemite,
if he will scan the titles which are given in the bibliography
appended to this volume. In addition to these, of course, are
hundreds of books and articles to which no reference has been
made in the present work.</p>
<p>The merchants of the towns along the routes of approach,
as well as the businessmen within the valley itself, felt the need
of providing more adequately for the greater numbers that
might be brought to their attractions. Foremost among the
provisions, naturally, was the construction of wagon roads.</p>
<p>To Dr. John T. McLean, the president of the Coulterville and
Yosemite Turnpike Company, belongs the honor of first making
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
the Yosemite Valley accessible to wheeled vehicles. The
Coulterville Company was formed in 1859. It had extended
its road to Crane Flat, and, at the insistence of Dr. McLean,
arranged with the Yosemite commissioners to build and maintain
a toll road to the floor of Yosemite Valley. The commissioners
had agreed that this company should have exclusive
rights on the north side of Yosemite Valley; that is, no other
company was to build a road into the valley from the north
for a period of ten years. Under this agreement, the Coulterville
Road was projected in 1870 and completed to the Merced
River in 1874. The following paragraph from a letter sent by
Dr. McLean to the president of the Yosemite National Park
Commission, 1899, gives interesting information on the discovery<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
of the Merced Grove of Big Trees, as well as a statement
regarding the opening of the Coulterville Road:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While making a survey for this road a grove of big trees was discovered,
its existence not having been previously known except to
Indians before these explorations for the building of this road were
prosecuted. It was determined to carry the road directly through
this grove, which was named the Merced Grove by me because of
its nearness to the Merced River. In order to carry the proposed
road through this new-found grove of <i>Sequoia gigantea</i> it was necessary,
in order to secure the best grades and shortest distances to Yosemite,
to leave the road already built at Hazel Green instead of at
Crane Flat six miles farther east. It was thought the greater length
of road required to start from Hazel Green and build through the
Merced Grove would be compensated by the advantage the road
would have of passing through this grove of over 50 <i>Sequoias</i> on
the way to Yosemite. The additional cost in construction of the
road by reason of this new departure from Hazel Green instead
of from Crane Flat was about $10,000. The work of construction
was vigorously prosecuted, and on June 17, 1874, the Yosemite was
first opened to travel by wheeled vehicles over this road, on that day
a number of stage coaches and passenger and freight teams passing
over it to the level of the valley.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The Big Oak Flat and Yosemite Turnpike Company applied
to extend their road to Yosemite Valley after the commissioners
had conveyed exclusive rights to the Coulterville Road.
The commissioners refused to violate their agreement with
McLean&rsquo;s company, but the Big Oak Flat Company secured
the passage of an act by the state legislature, which granted
the privilege asked. In July, 1874, the Big Oak Flat Road was
completed to the floor of Yosemite. Needless to say, this second
road functioned to the everlasting detriment of the Coulterville
route.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1874, Washburn, Chapman, Coffman and Company
of Mariposa sought the right to extend their Mariposa
Road to Yosemite Valley. The commissioners granted their
request on the same terms as given to the Coulterville Company.
On July 22, 1875, amid much celebrating, the Mariposa
Road was completed to the valley floor.</p>
<p>The easier mode of travel introduced by this road construction,
coupled with the increased publicity from the pen
and brush of enthusiasts, made for a substantial increase in
the number of Yosemite visitors. In keeping with this wagon-road
building was the steady extension of the Central Pacific
Railroad. Stockton, Modesto, Copperopolis, Berenda, Merced,
and Madera were, in turn, the terminals. Seven routes
to Yosemite made bids for the tourist travel. The Milton and
Calaveras route permitted of railroad conveyance to Milton.
Those who were induced to take the Berenda-Grants Springs
route took the train to Raymond. The Madera-Fresno Flats
route afforded railroad-coach transportation to Madera. The
Modesto-Coulterville route meant leaving the rails at Modesto.
The Merced-Coulterville route involved staging from
Merced. The Mariposa route also required detraining at Merced,
but the stage route followed took travelers through Hornitos
and Mariposa. Those tourists who chose the Milton-Big
Oak Flat route left the train at Copperopolis and traveled in
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
the stage to Chinese Camp, Priests, and into the valley on the
Big Oak Flat Road. Dodgers, pamphlets, and guidebooks furnished
by the competing towns and stage companies produced
a confusion to say the least.</p>
<p>The conveyances were of two types. At the height of the
season, when travel was heavy and roads dry, the Standard
Concord Coach was employed. At other times, a vehicle commonly
termed a &ldquo;mud wagon&rdquo; was put to use. During this era
of horse-drawn vehicles, the trains of pack mules were, of
course, replaced by great freight wagons. Today, in driving
over the old wagon roads, one is led to wonder how passenger
vehicles succeeded in passing the great freight outfits.</p>
<p>Some years ago, in searching through the objects left in a
deserted house in the ghost town, Bodie, I came upon a manuscript
describing staging as it was practiced in that famous
mining camp. What the unknown author has to say about the
business there applies to neighboring mountain regions, and
is a reminder of a phase of life of the &rsquo;eighties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stage coach is to California what the modern express train
is to Indiana, and people unaccustomed to mountain life can form
but little conception of the vast amount of transportation carried
on by means of coaches and freight wagons.</p>
<p>Even though California may truly be termed the &ldquo;Eden&rdquo; of
America, yet there is not a county in the state but has more or less
traffic for the stage coach, and in the northern and eastern part of
the state, especially, there is an entire network of well-graded roads,
resembling Eastern pikes. These roads are mostly owned by corporations
and, consequently, are toll roads.</p>
<p>Over these are run the fast stages drawn by from two to ten large
horses, and the great freight wagons drawn by from fourteen to
twenty mules.</p>
<p>The stage lines have divisions, as do railroads, and at the end
of each division there is a change of horses, thus giving the greatest
possible means for quick conveyance. Over each line there are
generally two stages per day, one each way. These carry passengers,
mail, and all express traffic. At each town is a Wells Fargo
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
office, and business is carried on in a similar manner to that of railroad
express offices. Telegraph lines are in use along the most important
roads.</p>
<p>The stage lines have time cards similar to railroads, and in case
a stage is a few minutes late, it causes as much anxiety as does the
delay of an O. &amp; M. express. A crowd is always waiting at the express
office; some are there for business, others through some curiosity
and to size up the passengers.</p>
<p>A stage from a mining town usually contains a bar of gold bullion
worth $25,000, which is being shipped to the mint. Bullion is
shipped from each mine once a month, but people always know
when this precious metal is aboard by the appearance of a fat, burly
officer perched beside the stage-driver, with two or three double-barreled
shotguns. He, of course, is serving as a kind of scarecrow
to the would-be stage robbers.</p>
<p>The average fare for riding on a stage is 15 cents per mile.</p>
<p>The manner in which freight is transported is quite odd, especially
to a &ldquo;Hoosier.&rdquo; Wagons of the largest size are used. Some of
these measure twelve feet from the ground to the top of the wagon
bed; then bows and canvas are placed over this, making a total
height of fifteen feet, at least. Usually three or four of these wagons
are coupled together, like so many cars, and then drawn by from
fourteen to twenty large mules. All these are handled by a single
driver. A team of this kind travels, when heavily loaded, about fifteen
miles per day, the same being spoken of always as the slow
freight. In some mining districts, however, where business is flush,
extra stages are put on for freight alone. These are termed the fast
freights. This business involves a large capital, and persons engaged
in it are known as forwarding companies. Even the freight or express
on goods from New York is sometimes collected a hundred
miles from any railroad, and so even to those living in the remote
mountain regions, this is about as convenient, and they seem to
enjoy life as well as if living in a railroad town.</p>
<p>The city of Bodie has its entire freight and passenger traffic
carried as mentioned above. A short time ago its population was
10,000; there were three daily papers and free mail delivery, and
all the improvements necessary to any modern town or city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prospect of a holdup always added to the thrill of staging.
Yosemite literature is not replete with road agent episodes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
but highwaymen did occasionally appear along the routes to
the valley. &ldquo;Black Bart,&rdquo; whose fame as a gentleman stage robber
was world-wide during the early &rsquo;eighties, met his downfall
in the Yosemite region on his twenty-eighth robbery.</p>
<p>Black Bart was a very unusual bandit. He took no human
lives. In fact, he never fired a weapon in any of his exploits. He
carried an unloaded shotgun and bluffed, successfully, twenty-seven
times. His forays began in 1877, and his returns were
such that he was enabled to reside in San Francisco as a respected
and rather dapper citizen. His absence from the city
on the occasions of his robberies was accounted for through
his story of visiting mines in which he held interests. His desire
to be well dressed and his penchant for clean linen proved
his undoing. It was a laundry mark on a handkerchief which
brought about his capture after his twenty-eighth robbery.</p>
<p>Not all the holdups along Yosemite roads took place in the
distant past. D. J. Foley&rsquo;s <i>Yosemite Tourist</i> for July 10, 1906,
carries the following account of a robbery that brings the melodramatic
influence of highwaymen into the very end of the
period of stage coach days. It was entitled &ldquo;Five Stages Held Up
by the Lone Highwayman of the Chowchilla, An Event Full of
Excitement and Interest,&rdquo; and reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the story of a plain, ordinary &ldquo;hold-up&rdquo; of the Raymond-Wawona-Yosemite
stages; and the time was Saturday afternoon at
ten minutes of four. The place was about six miles this side of
Ahwahnee, upon the side of the Chowchilla Mountain, about a
mile and a half this side of where a similar, but less important,
event took place last August.</p>
<p>The point, carefully selected by the bold robber was an ideal one.
The road here is in the form of the letter <span class="f">S</span>, flattened out, and he
selected the upper part of the letter, about all of the other parts
being visible.</p>
<p>The first stage was in charge of Will Palmer, one of the new
drivers. Puffing and sweating, the team of four were rounding the
turn in the road, when Walter Brode, who, with Mrs. F. J. House,
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
occupied the front seat, yelled: &ldquo;Hold up!&rdquo; For up the road a hundred
or more feet away he saw the fellow jump out from behind
some brush and, with his old 44 Winchester up to his shoulder, he
was advancing toward them. And in tones, musical and soft but
determined, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw out that box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver was not aware of the presence of the express box, but
it was there and Mr. Seth Hart threw it out like a gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of that stage,&rdquo; came the cool, determined command,
supplemented with that ugly-looking 44.</p>
<p>And out they got.</p>
<p>Then he requested one of the ladies, Miss Bowen, to &ldquo;pass the
hat around,&rdquo; which she did under protest.</p>
<p>The other stage was then about due and so he moved down the
road a bit to a point where he could keep them well &ldquo;covered,&rdquo; and
yet not be seen by the approaching stage. In the meantime all their
hands were up, for that big &ldquo;44&rdquo; was pointed their way.</p>
<p>Around the turn came the second stage with &ldquo;Josh&rdquo; Wrenn as
driver. No especial importance was attributed to the unusual sight,
believing it to be a joke. But the illusion was quickly dispelled
when out rang that soft and musical command: &ldquo;Get out of the
stage,&rdquo; and out they got, the vicious-looking &ldquo;44&rdquo; being much in
evidence. He lined them up with the others and then ordered a boy
of about fifteen to &ldquo;pass the hat around.&rdquo; The boy was badly scared,
and justly, too, and was about to comply with the request, when up
spoke C. E. McStay, a well-known business man of Los Angeles,
who very kindly offered to take the boy&rsquo;s place. To this the robber
consented, not suspecting the &ldquo;job&rdquo; that was so quickly put up on
him. For &ldquo;job&rdquo; it was, and one, too, that saved the passengers many
dollars and valuables. &ldquo;I quickly thought of and settled this proposition,&rdquo;
said Mr. McStay. &ldquo;If that boy passes the hat and searches
us, for this is what he was ordered to do, he will not use any discretion,
and we will all be heavy losers; whereas, if I can do that
honor I shall take but little, unless I have to.&rdquo; All this and more,
too, was thought out by Mr. McStay in less time than it takes to
write this, and so he acted at once, and to him is due the credit of
the &ldquo;buncoing&rdquo; that followed; for this mild-mannered, soft-voiced
Lone Highwayman of the Chowchilla was most thoroughly &ldquo;buncoed&rdquo;
in this change of &ldquo;hat passers,&rdquo; and he suspected it even before
the first stage was ordered to &ldquo;move on.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>And so in the fullness of his nerve&mdash;it&rsquo;s the real California-Los
Angeles kind, too, Mr. McStay became the apparent Chief Assistant
of the Lone Highwayman of the Chowchilla.</p>
<p>The third stage drove up in due time with the experience of the
second stage duplicated. The fourth wagon had a load of ladies,
and he did not order them to get out. Tho thus honored it was from
this wagon that he secured most of his coin. The passengers of the
fifth wagon &ldquo;lined up&rdquo; with the others. On this stage, in charge of
the driver, Ed Gordon, was a sack, for the Sugar Pine Mills, with
over $500 in it. From the zig-zag below they saw the crowd &ldquo;lined
up&rdquo; and they, suspecting the cause, helped the driver to hide the
sack under the cushion of the seat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the forty-year period which rightly may be considered
as the stagecoach era, a combination of influences were at
work. Politics sadly affected the management of the state grant
(brought into existence in 1864), and sheep threatened the
upper country not under the jurisdiction of the Yosemite commissioners.
A national park came into existence which physically
encompassed the state park and figuratively engulfed the
state management.</p>
<p>Improvements grew apace. New hotels and public camp
grounds were created; trails were built; the road system was
improved and enlarged; electricity developed; and a climax
reached with the construction of a railroad almost to the very
gates of the valley. In 1907 the Yosemite Valley Railroad
changed the entire aspect of stagecoach days by bringing its
coaches to El Portal.</p>
<p>With the advent of this new transportation, the long stage
ride was no longer necessary, but great fleets of horsedrawn
vehicles were still employed to convey visitors from the railhead
to Yosemite Valley. The various stage companies continued
to operate, but except for the Big Tree routes, their traffic
was greatly reduced. The Yosemite Valley Railroad menaced
the business of staging, but a far more ominous threat had
already appeared on the scene. Motor-driven vehicles were
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
proving to be a success. The automobile was introduced to
Yosemite more than a decade prior to the time when its official
entry was permitted by park regulations. The first car to climb
the Yosemite grades was a Stanley Steamer, and its driver was
A. E. Holmes of San Jose. In a letter to J. V. Lloyd, Mr. Holmes
testifies as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This trip was made in the month of July [1900] by way of Madera
and Raymond in a Stanley Steamer car that was manufactured just
outside of the city of Boston. I was accompanied on this trip by
my brother, F. H. Holmes.</p>
<p>At that time Boysen took our photographs in the Valley; one at
the foot of Yosemite Falls, and another near Mirror Lake.</p>
<p>The body that is shown in the photograph is not the original
body that came with the car, but one that was made just for the trip
into the Yosemite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To what extent noisy automobiles were regarded as a menace
may be sensed upon considering the following &ldquo;Instruction&rdquo;
posted about the park and published with <i>Rules and Regulations</i>
during the later years of the stagecoach era:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(4) <i>Bicycles.</i>&mdash;The greatest care must be exercised by persons
using bicycles. On meeting a team the rider must stop and stand at
side of road between the bicycle and the team&mdash;the outer side of
the road if on a grade or curve. In passing a team from the rear, the
rider should learn from the driver if his horses are liable to frighten,
in which case the driver should halt, and the rider dismount and
walk past, keeping between the bicycle and the team....</p>
<p>(9) <i>Miscellaneous.</i>&mdash;Automobiles and motor cycles are not permitted
in the park.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the railroad did to the stagecoach, the automobile,
aided by storm, did to the railroad. On December 11, 1937, as
a result of prolonged and heavy warm rains which melted the
early snow cover at elevations as high as 10,000 feet, a flood
developed in the basins of Yosemite and Tenaya creeks, and to
a lesser degree in the other Yosemite watersheds. The notch
at the top of Yosemite Falls was filled almost to the brim with
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
muddy water that was estimated to leap 150 feet away from
the cliff at the top. In the valley itself Yosemite Creek was half
a mile wide, and the Merced River overflowed its banks on
a similar rampage. Flood scars were clearly visible in the chutes
of the valley walls nine years later. In the Merced Canyon far
below the valley several miles of both the All-Year Highway
and the Yosemite Valley Railway were destroyed.</p>
<p>The expense of replacing miles of twisted rails and missing
roadbed, the loss of passenger traffic to automobile travel, and
finally the loss of freight revenue when the Yosemite Sugar
Pine Lumber Company sold its major holdings, combined to
put the railway out of business. In 1945, wrecking crews took
up the track, and another pioneer railroad disappeared.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><i>EXPLORERS</i></h2>
<p>The influx of travelers even in the days of horse trails and
the stagecoach brought a demand to know more of the
valley and the region as a whole. Maps were needed, and the
desires of travelers for dependable information brought survey
parties into the park. The first of these, the Geological Survey
of California, was in Yosemite in the years 1863-1867. Josiah
Dwight Whitney was director of the survey, and William H.
Brewer, his principal assistant. A guidebook based upon their
investigations was published in 1868. Most of the mapping
was done by Clarence King, Charles F. Hoffmann, and James
T. Gardiner. King was later to become the first director of the
United States Geological Survey and to write a dramatized
account of his adventures in Yosemite and the Sierra as one
of the important contributions to the literature of the range,
<i>Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada</i>. Later mountaineers
have not always been able to find terrain hazards he described
but they have enjoyed his story, admittedly written for an armchair
audience, and have made due allowance for an aspect of
greater severity that existed in the Sierra of his day.</p>
<p>A party of the Wheeler Survey, under George Montague
Wheeler, in general charge of the Geographical Surveys west
of the 100th Meridian, was in Yosemite in the late &rsquo;seventies
and early &rsquo;eighties and in 1883 produced a large-scale topographic
map of Yosemite Valley and vicinity. Lieut. M. M.
Macomb was responsible for the Yosemite work.</p>
<p>During July and August, of 1890, Professor George Davidson
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, together
with his assistants, occupied the summit of Mount Conness for
the purpose of closing a link in the main triangulation which
connected with the transcontinental surveys.</p>
<p>Large instruments and much equipment had to be transported
to the summit of the mountain by pack animals and
upon the shoulders of men.</p>
<p>Astronomical observations were made at night, and during
the daylight hours horizontal angles were measured on distant
peaks in the Coast Ranges from which heliotropes were
constantly showing toward Mount Conness. A small square
wooden observatory, 8 by 8 feet, housed the 20-inch theodolite
mounted upon a concrete pier. Sixteen twisted-wire cables
fastened the observatory to the granite mountain top and kept
it from being blown away.</p>
<p>The officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey party under
Professor Davidson were J. J. Gilbert, Isaac Winston, Fremont
Morse, and Frank W. Edmonds.</p>
<p>As a result of his own travels and surveys in the region, J. N.
LeConte prepared a map of the Sierra adjacent to Yosemite and
Hetch Hetchy valleys, which was published by the Sierra Club
in 1893, and army officers in charge of park administration did
much important map making in the 1890&rsquo;s. The United States
Geological Survey began its mapping of the region embraced
within the present park in 1891 and completed the surveys in
1909. R. B. Marshall and H. E. L. Feusier surveyed the Yosemite,
Dardanelles, and Mount Lyell sheets; A. H. Sylvester and
George R. Davis, the Bridgeport Quadrangle. Operating as
they did with limited funds, their efforts spread over a vast
territory, and confronted with a short season, they inevitably
made some errors on their maps. In correct editions of these
maps some ridges, lakes, and canyons have been moved, but
today&rsquo;s travelers may still find lakes and glaciers which are not
on the map, and may find a few of these features on the map
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
but not on the ground. It is not the errors of Sierra mapmakers,
however, but the measure of success they achieved, which is
remarkable. In the higher reaches of the Sierra today it is extremely
difficult to discover, after a particularly heavy winter,
which snow field conceals a lake and which covers merely a
meadow or an expanse of ice. Nor is the Sierra itself utterly
static. At least two small lakes which formed behind dams of
glacial moraine have disappeared recently when the dams were
undermined.</p>
<p>Perhaps the ultimate in Yosemite mapping, from the geomorphologist&rsquo;s
point of view, is the Yosemite Valley Sheet, prepared
by the United States Geological Survey in co&ouml;peration
with the State of California. The map is of large scale, and the
topography, the work of Fran&ccedil;ois E. Matthes, is extremely
accurate, giving it something of the quality of a relief map on
a plane surface. Even the overhangs of the cliffs are depicted.
The 1946 edition of this sheet falls short in that detail has been
lost through the overprinting of topographical shading.</p>
<p>Considered for their practical guidance to the user of Yosemite
trails, the U. S. Geological Survey maps of the back country
are most important. The 700-odd miles of maintained trails
which make much of the park accessible to the hiker and rider
appear upon these topographical maps in true relationship
to the physical features through which they pass. A useful
guidebook covering the routes in and around Yosemite Valley,
as well as many of the park trails south of the Tuolumne River,
is the <i>Illustrated Guide to Yosemite Valley</i>, by Virginia and
Ansel Adams. In this volume road and trail diagrams are stylized
to impart, simply and directly, information on distances,
altitudes, and relative positions. Walter A. Starr, Jr.&rsquo;s <i>Guide
to the John Muir Trail and the High Sierra Region</i> includes a
section (Part I) on the trails of the Yosemite National Park
region, and the map which accompanies it relates the high
country trails to the road systems of both the east and west
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
slopes. This guide, published by the Sierra Club, is kept up-to-date
through the production of frequent editions.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Early Indian Routes</span></h3>
<p>Before the story of trail building within the national park is
presented, it is worthwhile to review briefly the history of the
approach routes outside the present limits of the park&mdash;the
trails followed by the Indian fighters and miners.</p>
<p>Most of the early routes of the white man across the Yosemite
Sierra and out of the valley itself followed Indian trails. The
discovery of arrow points and knife blades on the slopes of
some of the higher Yosemite peaks indicates that the Miwok
Indians entered the high, rough country in pursuit of game.
Their regularly established trade with the Monos also is a
matter of record. Indian Canyon and the Vernal and Nevada
falls gorge of the Merced provided two much used routes out
of the valley to the east, and the Old Inspiration Point-Wawona-Fresno
Flats-Coarse Gold route gave access to the foothill
country to the west. There were other ancient routes on
the valley walls accessible to an able-bodied Indian; however,
except in emergency they probably found little use.</p>
<p>Walker, west-bound in 1833, followed the Miwok-Mono trail
on the divide between the Merced and Tuolumne watersheds,
having reached this divide, in all likelihood, via the maze of
canyons formed by the tributaries of the East Walker River
and the feeder streams of the Tuolumne River. White men in
pursuit of eastward-fleeing Indians in 1851 penetrated to the
Tenaya Lake basin, and one party in 1852 crossed to the east
side via Bloody Canyon, as already described. This party returned
to the San Joaquin on a branch of the Mono Trail which
crossed Cathedral Pass, thence into Little Yosemite Valley,
Mono Meadows, Peregoy Meadows, and Wawona. In all these
travels definite trails of the aborigines could be followed even
though many parts of the routes were buried in snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>In the foothill region west of the park ancient Indian paths
enabled gold seekers to reach much of the terrain in which they
were interested. Barrett and Gifford (1933, p. 128) report that
a Mr. Woods discovered gold on Woods Creek near the present
Jamestown, Tuolumne County, in June, 1848, several months
before the general rush of miners into the territory of the
Southern Miwok. In this locality Indian trails connected the
several rancherias near the present town, Sonora, with similar
Indian villages on the Merced. In the Tuolumne country, also,
a primitive transmountain route gave access via Sonora Pass
to the favored locality now known as Bridgeport Valley. The
wagon road which was opened here very early in the gold-rush
period followed closely the route of the Indians. That there
were prehistoric lanes of travel in the high mountains which
connected the Sonora Pass and Mono (Bloody Canyon) routes
seems likely but no record of such north-south trails of the
Indians has been handed down, other than the statements
made by Walker and Leonard regarding their route from the
Walker River country to the Tuolumne-Merced divide.</p>
<p>The country south of the Merced drainage system was popular,
both with the Miwok and the Chukchansi, a group of the
Yokuts Indians. Kroeber (1925, pp. 446, 481-482, 526) has recorded
the distribution of ancient Miwok villages on the South
Fork of the Merced, on Mariposa Creek, and on the Chowchilla
and Fresno rivers. The primitive trails which connected
these villages provided a network of lanes through the hills
well known to J. D. Savage and his contemporary forty-niners
who frequented the hills and stream courses north of the San
Joaquin River. These Indian trails became the first routes followed
by the miner and his pack outfits. A few were &ldquo;improved&rdquo;
by their first white users to become fairly good horse
trails and later some of them were transformed into wagon
roads. Today the old routes are not easily distinguished from
the more recent logging roads which lace back and forth everywhere
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
through the pine country south of the park, but the investigative
motorist who will check against the maps made prior
to the period of logging at the turn of the century may identify
the old routes and follow them in exploring the country surrounding
Wawona, Mariposa, Miami, Nipinnawasee, Hites
Cove, Fish Camp, Bear Valley, Hornitos, and several other historic
and prehistoric sites in the Mariposa region.</p>
<p>The Chukchansi, northernmost of the Yokuts, occupied the
country south of the Fresno River and at times crossed that
stream and overlapped upon the lands of the Miwok. Prior to
the Yosemite Indian War with the whites, 1850-1852, they
seem to have been on friendly terms with the Miwok. Chukchansi
villages close to the border of Miwok territory existed
at Fresno Flats (near the present Oakhurst, Madera County),
Coarse Gold, Magnet, and on the San Joaquin near Hutchins.
As was true of the Miwok villages, primitive trails connected
these rancherias and extended into the country of the Chukaimina
on the south and into the Mono territory to the east. In
this part of the Sierra, the Monos claimed a goodly part of the
west slope, including the present Bass Lake region and the
higher country drained by the San Joaquin and Kings rivers.
At the time of the Yosemite Indian War, these west-slope Piutes
(Monos) were allied with the Chowchillas and Chukchansi.
The intricate trail system of the densely populated belts, characterized
by the Digger pine (Upper Sonoran Zone) and the
oaks and ponderosa pine (Transition Zone), fed westward into
major routes to the great San Joaquin Valley and eastward to
high passes on the crest of the Sierra. Of these last-mentioned
routes, those across Sonora Pass, Bond Pass, Buckeye Pass,
Bloody Canyon, Agnew Pass, Mammoth Pass, Mono Pass (headwaters
of the South Fork of the San Joaquin River), Pine Creek
Pass, and Piute Pass were especially important to the Indians
of the Yosemite region. At least some of these passes were traversed
by horses before the advent of the white man.</p>

<p>More than a few of the Indians of the Yosemite region had,
prior to the gold rush, lived in the Spanish mission towns along
the coast. Adam Johnston, Indian agent at the time of the
Yosemite Indian War, stated of the Chowchilla and Chukchansi,
&ldquo;The most of them are wild, though they have among
them many who have been educated at the missions, and
who have fled from their real or supposed oppressors to the
mountains. These speak the Spanish language as well as their
native tongue.&rdquo; (Russell, 1931, p. 172.) As might be expected,
the mountain tribes maintained their long-established contact
with the Indian population of the lower valleys, and numerous
routes led from the rancherias of the hill tribes out upon the San
Joaquin Valley and to the coast.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the first penetration of the Yosemite Valley
by white men was the result of miners&rsquo; activities in the Mariposa
hills. In reaching the hills and in entering the valley, the
white prospectors of the gold-rush period followed well-defined
trails long used by Indians. Within a few years after the close
of hostilities with the Sierra tribes, the events described in
the chapter on early mining excitements east of Yosemite took
place. Here, also, the primitive paths of the Indian opened the
way. The sheepherder, contemporary with the miner of the
high country, also followed the trails of the Indian, and his
flocks, together with the cattleman&rsquo;s herds, did their part in
&ldquo;grading&rdquo; the routes and making them conspicuous.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Trail Builders</span></h3>
<p>When Yosemite National Park was created in 1890, the U. S.
Army took over the administration of the federal area which
almost surrounded the state reservation. To aid patrolling in
the park, a full program of exploration and mapping was
launched. Capt. Alexander Rodgers, Col. Harry G. Benson,
Major W. W. Forsyth, and Lts. N. F. McClure and Milton F.
Davis made particularly important contribution to the work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>The existing fine system of trails so important to protection
and enjoyment of Yosemite National Park had its inception in
the plan of the U. S. Army. Almost at once after assuming
responsibility for the care of the park, commanding officers
initiated construction of trails, and at this juncture the location
of primitive Indian trails was no longer a prime consideration
in defining routes. The story of trail building by the
U. S. Army will be told in a later part of this chapter.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that in the exploration for trails and passes,
certain peaks should be climbed. The first recorded ascents of
Yosemite&rsquo;s peaks are attributed to members of the various
survey parties. Perhaps the first was the ascent of Mount Hoffmann
in 1863 by Whitney, Brewer, and Hoffmann. King
climbed it in 1864 and with Gardiner climbed Mount Conness
that same year, following with an ascent of Mount Clark, not
without adventure, in 1866. Muir climbed Mounts Dana and
Hoffmann, and far more difficult Cathedral Peak, three years
later. Probably the first Yosemite ascent for the challenge of it
by a casual tourist was that of Mount Lyell, highest peak in the
park, in 1871. According to Hutchings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Members of the State Geological Survey Corps having considered
it impossible to reach the summit of this lofty peak, the writer
was astonished to learn from Mr. A. T. Tileston [John Boies Tileston]
of Boston, after his return to the Valley from a jaunt of
health and pleasure in the High Sierra, that he had personally
proven it to be possible by making the ascent. Incredible as it
seemed at the time, three of us found Mr. Tileston&rsquo;s card upon it
some ten days afterward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Tileston, writing to his wife from Clark and Moore&rsquo;s
after the climb on Mount Lyell, explained that he ascended
nearly to the snow line on August 28, 1871, and next morning
&ldquo;climbed the mountain and reached the top of the highest
pinnacle (&lsquo;inaccessible, according to the State Geological Survey&rsquo;)
before eight.&rdquo; (Tileston, 1922, pp. 89-90.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>John Muir reached the summit of Mount Lyell later that
year. Muir undoubtedly climbed in part as a response to the
challenge of summits but could hardly be considered a casual
tourist.</p>
<p>Four years later another summit, of which Whitney had
said, it &ldquo;never has been, and never will be trodden by human
foot,&rdquo; was ascended by a man climbing merely for the fun
of it. In 1875, George G. Anderson, continuing where John
Conway, a valley resident, had been stopped by difficulty and
danger, tackled the climb of Half Dome with ideas of his own.
According to Muir:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anderson began with Conway&rsquo;s old rope, which had been left in
place, and resolutely drilled his way to the top, inserting eye-bolts
five or six feet apart, and making his rope fast to each in succession,
resting his feet on the last bolt while he drilled a hole for the next
above. Occasionally some irregularity in the curve, or slight foothold,
would enable him to climb a few feet without the rope, which
he would pass and begin drilling again, and thus the whole work
was accomplished in less than a week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anderson&rsquo;s climb was the beginning of a search for routes
to prominent heights in Yosemite that continues today. The
fame of Yosemite&rsquo;s wonders was spreading through the world,
and the advent of stage roads brought a multitude of visitors
who preferred to see the region without having to drill to do
so. It was imperative that officials in charge of the state reservation
improve and multiply the faint Indian trails in order
that eager visitors might reach the valley rim and the High
Sierra beyond.</p>
<p>Because appropriations made by the state legislature for
the use of the Yosemite Valley Commission were too small to
enable that executive body to undertake a program of trail
building, toll privileges were granted to certain responsible
individuals in return for the construction of some of the much-needed
trails. Albert Snow, John Conway, James McCauley,
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
Washburn and McCready, and James Hutchings were prominent
in this contractual arrangement with the Yosemite commissioners.</p>
<p>Two trails antedate the regime of the Yosemite Valley Commissioners&mdash;the
trail to Mirror Lake and the Vernal Fall Trail. No
record exists identifying the builders of these pioneer trails.
Albert Snow, 1870, built a horse trail from &ldquo;Register Rock&rdquo; on
the Vernal Fall Trail, via Clark Point, to his &ldquo;La Casa Nevada&rdquo;
on the flat between Vernal and Nevada falls. In 1871, John
Conway, working for McCauley, started construction of the
Four Mile Trail from the base of Sentinel Rock to Glacier
Point. The project was completed in 1872. The old Mono
Trail of the Indians between Little Yosemite and Glacier Point
was followed by Washburn and McCready when they constructed
their toll route here in 1872. In 1874, James Hutchings
met the cost of a horse trail up Indian Canyon, which
by 1877 already had fallen into such disrepair as to make it
accessible only to hikers. The disintegration progressed rapidly,
and the &ldquo;improved&rdquo; aboriginal route to the north rim
found use during a comparatively few years of Yosemite tourist
travel. Geographically and topographically it has much to commend
it; in the current master plan of Yosemite National Park
it is carried as the trail proposal calculated &ldquo;to provide the best
all-year access to the upper country on the north side of the
valley.&rdquo; Early action is expected which will place it on the map
again. The Yosemite Falls Trail, started by John Conway in
1873 and completed to the north rim in 1877, was carried by
its builder and owner still higher to the summit of Eagle Peak,
highest of the Three Brothers. John Conway&rsquo;s homemade surveying
instruments used in trail building are preserved in the
Yosemite Museum.</p>

<p>By 1882 the State Legislature initiated a program of purchasing
and maintaining the Yosemite trails which had been
privately built and operated on a toll basis. The Four Mile
Trail to Glacier Point was first on the docket. A number of the
other toll trails reverted to the state at this time through the
expiration of leases. In 1886 rights to all remaining trails and
to those portions of the Coulterville and Big Oak Flat roads
within the boundary of the Yosemite Grant were purchased
by the state and made free to the public.</p>
<p>At the time Yosemite National Park was established a
great part of the northern section of the reservation was quite
unknown except to cattlemen, sheepmen, and a few prospectors
and trappers. As previously mentioned, the U. S. Army
officers responsible for the administration of the national park
at this time opened a new era in High Sierra trail development.
From 1891 to 1914 a succession of officers, with a number of
troops of cavalry, worked with diligence and with great ingenuity
in locating trails, in contracting for their construction, and
in counteracting the forces of exploiters who looked upon this
great mountain domain as their own. At that time the back
country trails were limited to the Tioga Road, which had deteriorated
to the status of a horse trail; a trail along the southern
boundary from Wawona to Crescent and Johnson lakes
and Chiquito Pass, thence to Devils Postpile; the old Indian
route from Wawona to Tuolumne Meadows via Cathedral Pass;
two trails to Hetch Hetchy and Lake Eleanor from Hog Ranch,
near the present Mather Ranger Station; and a trail from
Tuolumne Meadows to Mount Conness. This dearth of marked
routes was corrected quickly. Regular patrol routes for protective
purposes were established, and the soldiers located,
marked, and supervised the construction of the trails needed
in policing the area. The large &ldquo;T&rdquo; blazed on the trees along
the routes of the cavalrymen remain as evidences of the Army&rsquo;s
activities and are still familiar signs in much of the Yosemite
back country.</p>
<p>By the time of the return of the Yosemite Grant and the
Mariposa Grove of Big Trees to Federal administration in
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
1906, the Army had worked wonders in providing a system of
trails. C. Frank Brockman (1943, p. 96) summarizes the story
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The original trail system of 1891 had been extended to include a
trail up Little Yosemite Valley to Merced Lake, Vogelsang Pass and
thence down Rafferty Creek to Tuolumne Meadows, a route that
is familiar to all High Sierra hikers of the present day. The Isberg
Pass trail to the east boundary of the park had been marked and
Fernandez Pass, farther to the south, had also been rendered accessible
by a trail that branched from the original trail along the
southern boundary. The present trail from Tuolumne Meadows
up the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne to Donohue Pass also dates
from this period. From Tuolumne Meadows a trail also reached out
into the remote northern portion of the park to the vicinity of
Glen Aulin, thence up Alkali Creek to Cold, Virginia, and Matterhorn
canyons. From the latter point this route continued westward
to Smedberg Lake, down Rogers Canyon, eventually passing
through Pleasant Valley and over Rancheria Mountain to Hetch
Hetchy Valley. The Ten Lakes area was accessible by means of a trail
originating on the Tioga Road near White Wolf, and from Hetch
Hetchy Valley trails radiated to Tiltill Mountain, Miguel Meadow,
Lake Eleanor, Vernon Lake, and up Moraine Ridge to a point
near what is today known as the &ldquo;Golden Stairs,&rdquo; overlooking the
lower portion of Jack Main Canyon. A route approximating the
present Forsythe trail from Little Yosemite around the southern
shoulder of Clouds Rest to Tenaya Lake had been established, and
from Tenaya Lake the point now known as Glen Aulin could be
reached by the McGee Lake trail. The routes taken by these early
trails were essentially the same as those of the present day and points
mentioned will be familiar to all who enjoy roaming about the
Yosemite back country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the National Park Service came into existence in
1916, the broad design of the trail system was essentially as it
is at present. The more important trails constructed during the
last years of Army administration and in the first years of the
National Park Service regime include the Tenaya zigzags built
in 1911; the Glen Aulin-Pate Valley route, 1917-1925; the
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
Babcock Lake Trail; the Yosemite Creek-Ten Lakes Trail; the
Ledge Trail to Glacier Point, 1918; the Harden Lake-Pate
Valley Trail, 1919; Pate Valley-Pleasant Valley Trail, 1920;
and the Ottoway Lakes-Washburn Lake Trail in 1941.</p>
<p>Gabriel Sovulewski, who for more than thirty years supervised
the construction of Yosemite trails, once outlined for me
the amazing story of the evolution of the trail system from
Indian routes and sheep trails (Sovulewski, 1928, pp. 25-28).
Mr. Sovulewski stated, &ldquo;Most of these improvements were
made on my suggestion, and sometimes at my insistence, yet it
is necessary to bear in mind that the credit is not all due to me,
even though I did work hard. I share the credit with all superintendents
under whom I have served. They gave me freedom
to do the work which I have enjoyed immensely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Col. H. C. Benson, one of the superintendents referred to
by Mr. Sovulewski, wrote in 1924:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The successful working out of the trails and the continuation of
developing them is due largely to the loyalty and hard work of Mr.
Gabriel Sovulewski. Too much credit can not be given to this man
for the development of Yosemite National Park. (Brockman, 1943,
p. 102.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="sc">The John Muir Trail</span></h3>
<p>A fitting climax to the High Sierra trails in Yosemite National
Park is found in that portion of the trail system which has been
designated the John Muir Trail. Beginning at the LeConte
Lodge in Yosemite Valley, this route follows the Merced River
Trail to Little Yosemite, thence along the ancient Indian route
over Cathedral Pass to Tuolumne Meadows, up the Lyell Fork
of the Tuolumne to Donohue Pass (where the trail leaves the
national park), along the east slope to Island Pass, then back
to the headwaters of westward-flowing streams to Devils Postpile
and Reds Meadow on the San Joaquin, south to Mono
Creek and other tributaries of the South Fork of the San Joaquin,
into Kings Canyon National Park at Evolution Valley,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
over Muir Pass to the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the
Kings, over Mather Pass in the South Fork of the Kings, over
Pinchot Pass, Glen Pass, and into Sequoia National Park at
Foresters Pass, thence south to Mount Whitney. At Whitney
Pass the route descends the east slope until it connects with a
spur of the El Camino Sierra at Whitney Portal above the town
of Lone Pine. Along the route are 148 peaks more than 13,000
feet in height. The Sierra crest, itself, is more than 13,000 feet
above the sea for eight and one-half miles adjacent to Mount
Whitney. The trail traverses one of the most extensive areas
yet remaining practically free from automobile roads.</p>
<p>In Sequoia National Park, the High Sierra Trail from Giant
Forest to Mount Whitney enters the John Muir Trail on Wallace
Creek, a tributary of the Kern. Thus does the John Muir
Trail connect the national parks of the Sierra, traversing in
some 260 miles most of the grandest regions of the High Sierra.</p>
<p>The National Park Service, the Forest Service, and the State
of California have co&ouml;perated in making the John Muir Trail
a reality. The phenomenal route had its inception during the
1914 Sierra Club Outing, when it was suggested to officers of
the club that the State of California might well appropriate
funds with which to develop trails in the High Sierra. Upon
the death of John Muir, president of the club, appropriation
bills were introduced for the purpose of creating a memorial
trail. The first appropriation of $10,000 enabled the state engineer,
Wilbur F. McClure, to explore a practical route along the
crest of the Sierra from Yosemite to Mount Whitney. McClure
made two trips into the Sierra and then conferred with the
Sierra Club and officers of the U. S. Forest Service before designating
the route. During the next twenty years several state
appropriations were forthcoming, and the federal agencies
most concerned, the Forest Service and the National Park Service,
entered into the program of locating and building the trail.
The earlier explorations of Muir, Solomons, LeConte, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
numerous state and federal survey parties contributed to the
success of the undertaking. The maps of the Geological Survey
greatly facilitated the work.</p>
<p>While Stephen T. Mather was still Assistant Secretary of
the Interior and before the National Park Service was created,
the &ldquo;Mather Mountain Party of 1916&rdquo; assembled in Yosemite
Valley preparatory to an inspection of the John Muir Trail.
This expedition received the support of the Geological Survey.
Frank B. Ewing, at that time an employee of the Geological
Survey, was chief guide and general manager. As an employee
of the National Park Service, he has remained in Yosemite
National Park ever since that early march along the John Muir
Trail and has been a principal party to the National Park Service
trail developments previously described. The section of the
John Muir Trail in Yosemite National Park was born and has
matured under Ewing&rsquo;s personal supervision. Mr. Mather&rsquo;s
expedition of 1916 helped to crystallize ideas regarding the
Muir Trail and established it in the official minds and master
plans of the new National Park Service and the U. S. Forest
Service. Robert Sterling Yard, a member of the Mather party
and later editor for the new bureau, wrote a sparkling account
of the expedition (Yard, 1918). The route at that time was the
same within Yosemite National Park as it is today, but the physical
condition of the trail has improved mightily. The Mather
party traveled the John Muir Trail to Evolution Valley, beyond
which the trail was described as impassable to horses.
From there the party moved westward to the North Fork of
the Kings, then south to the Tehipite Valley, Kanawyers on the
South Fork, and yet further southward to the Giant Forest.
Today the Giant Forest is more accessible from the John Muir
Trail via the High Sierra Trail.</p>
<p>In promoting the development of the John Muir Trail and
in fostering the use of High Sierra trails, generally, the Sierra
Club has ever been pre&euml;minent among the advocates of mountaineering.
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
Among its members are many individuals who
have contributed to the shaping of National Park Service policies.
This club, which was organized about the same time that
Yosemite National Park was created, defined its purposes: &ldquo;To
explore, enjoy, and render accessible the mountain regions of
the Pacific Coast; to publish authentic information concerning
them; to enlist the support and co&ouml;peration of the people and
the Government in preserving the forests and other natural
features of the Sierra Nevada.&rdquo; For nearly half a century the
Sierra Club has centered its attention upon the security and
well-being of the natural attributes of Yosemite and has worked
to make those attributes known and appreciated. The national
parks, national forests, and state parks, generally, have benefited
greatly by the continuous interest of the club, and the
trail and road systems of Yosemite National Park, especially,
have received its study.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A New Emphasis on the High Country</span></h3>
<p>With the completion of an all-year highway into Yosemite Valley
and the realignment of portions of the Big Oak Flat and
Tioga roads, the accessibility of Yosemite National Park to the
motorist reached its peak, and since that time serious thought
has been given to modification of the road system. The Commonwealth
Club, in a comprehensive report entitled, &ldquo;Should
We Stop Building New Roads into California&rsquo;s High Mountains?&rdquo;
concluded that accessibility had already reached, if it
had not passed, a desirable maximum, on the basis of a stand for
the preservation of mountain wilderness values made by many
Sportsmen&rsquo;s organizations and the Sierra Club. The National
Park Service gave consideration, in its Yosemite Master Plan,
to the abandonment and obliteration of certain roads which
were either superseded by highways or which could be relocated
to reduce any detrimental effects upon the mountain
landscape. Col. C. G. Thomson led in establishing this trend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Studies were made by the park administration, the concessionaire,
and various organizations outside of the park of
means by which present-day visitors, who were now arriving
by automobile in hurried throngs numbering as many as
30,000 persons on a single holiday week end, might enjoy the
park to some degree at least in the manner that the pioneers
had enjoyed it. Improvement of the trails, of outlying facilities,
education in the means of trail travel, and the development of
an all-season program that would help to spread the peak of
travel into a plateau, were steps taken and which are being
taken in the attempt to halt the tendency of the public to make
of Yosemite Valley an urban &ldquo;resort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>High Sierra camps were developed, as described elsewhere
in this book. They were visited by travelers afoot or in the
saddle, and &ldquo;foot-burners&rdquo; and pack outfits visited the remote
regions of the park, where no improvements upon nature are
permitted other than those which a man can carry in&mdash;and
carry back out again when he leaves. The numbers of people
who are attracted to the back country have increased mightily,
but the congestion of crowds in Yosemite Valley is still great.
This fact in itself constitutes a reason for increasing the effort
to introduce visitors to the wonders of the wild high country.</p>
<p>David R. Brower, an officer of the Sierra Club and an ardent
proponent of rock-climbing as a sport, and an accomplished
skier, has reviewed the development of these forms of recreation
in Yosemite. He has kindly agreed to my use of the following
portion of an enlightening account, most of which has not
previously appeared in print:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a few people&mdash;fortunately, perhaps, a very few&mdash;even a
trail detracts a little from the feeling of &lsquo;roughing it.&rsquo; Too
clearly, the foot of man, or of mule, has trod there before them.
Consequently, those who would get especially close to nature
have become skilled in woodcraft so as to take care of themselves
and have then struck off not only from the highways
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
and roads, but also from the horse trails and footpaths. Muir
and Anderson were pioneers in this form of recreation. A few
have carried on where they left off. Routes were found through
trailless Tenaya Canyon to the high country above; Muir
Gorge, in the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne, presented an
obstacle where the waters of that river were confined in a narrow,
vertical-walled box canyon, but it has proved not to be
an obstacle to good swimmers in periods of low water. Muir
discovered Fern Ledge and crossed it along the tremendous
face of the Yosemite Falls cliff, until he was under the upper
fall itself. Charles Michael, years later, and William Kat, to this
day, followed Muir&rsquo;s footsteps and made new ones of their own
on other Yosemite byways, such as the Gunsight to the top of
Bridalveil Fall, Mount Starr King, the Lower Brother. For the
most part these men, and others of similar bent, climbed alone.
Michael was almost to regret it when, on an ascent of Piute
Point, he fell a few feet, broke his leg, and was just able to
drag himself back to the valley&mdash;to climb again when the break
had knitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These pioneers of the byways were limited, not by lack of
enterprise, but by lack of modern equipment and the technique
for its use; both of these required assets came to Yosemite
in 1933. A year before that a Rock-Climbing Section was
formed in the Sierra Club, and its members brought Alpine
technique, which they had practiced and improved in local
metropolitan rock parks, to Yosemite. Skillfully using rope
and piton technique, and developing their balance climbing
to a point where they are able to ascend Half Dome without
recourse to any artificial aids, much less cableways, members
of this and similar sections, men and women alike, have pioneered
many new routes on the valley walls, some extremely
difficult. The present total of routes to the rim, exclusive of the
trails, is forty-five. Spires and pinnacles not accessible by other
means were especially challenging. The higher and lower
Cathedral Spires were climbed in 1934 by the party of Jules
M. Eichorn, Richard M. Leonard, and Bestor Robinson. The
routes for this and other climbs are described in the Yosemite
Valley section of a comprehensive &lsquo;Climber&rsquo;s Guide to the
High Sierra,&rsquo; being published serially by the Sierra Club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Construed at present as the ultimate in technical rock-climbing
was the ascent, September 2, 1946, of the Lost Arrow
by the party of Jack Arnold, Robin Hansen, Fritz Lippmann,
and Anton Nelson. The party used more than a thousand feet
of rope and many pounds of mountaineer&rsquo;s hardware. They
first managed to throw a light line over the summit. Two men
remained in support at the rim. The other two went down a
rope to the notch separating the pinnacle from the valley wall,
and with expert technique were able to climb 100 feet of the
rock&rsquo;s outer face, nearly 3,000 sheer feet above the valley floor,
until they could reach the lower end of the line. With this they
pulled rope over the summit. Another 100 feet of climbing on
that rope, with help from the men on the rim, brought them
to the top on the evening of the third day. On the crowded,
rounded summit they drilled small holes for two expansion
bolts, anchored ropes to them, and in the moonlight worked
across the gap to the rim on the airy, swinging ropes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needless to say, such climbs as this should not be undertaken
without the necessary background of experience. Foolhardy
attempts by the overoptimistic to take short cuts or
cross-country routes into unknown hazards all too often result
in arduous and dangerous rescue operations by park rangers.
The National Park Service requires, in Yosemite and in other
&lsquo;mountaineering&rsquo; parks, that persons desiring to climb off
the trail register first at park headquarters, where, as a matter
of the visitor&rsquo;s own protection, he can be advised whether he
has the adequate equipment or skill for his proposed undertaking,
and where he announces his destination so that rangers
will know where to look for him in case of trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;If trails or cross-country routes have afforded the summer
visitor a fuller knowledge of Yosemite National Park and its
hidden wild places, certainly the improvement of access to various
park areas in winter has also increased the enjoyment of
the superlative scenery for which Yosemite was set aside as a
national park in the first place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first days of winter sports in Yosemite, snowballing,
tobogganing, skating, and sliding down small hills on toe-strapped
skis was enough for the winter visitor. Snow, to Californians
at least, was novelty enough in itself. But the surge
of interest in skiing as a sport of skill that arrived after World
War I, the resulting vast improvement in ski equipment and
apparel, and the winter accessibility brought about by use of
snow-removal equipment, inevitably stimulated skiers to demand
greatly improved facilities for skiing. The National Park
Service, required by law to be custodians of outstanding scenic
resources for all the people, in all seasons, for present and
future enjoyment, very properly &lsquo;made haste slowly.&rsquo; Other
areas, administered by agencies whose obligations were less
exacting, developed facilities far more rapidly, and the pressure
on the National Park Service, in Yosemite and elsewhere,
was greatly increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ski development in Yosemite involved serious scenic,
economic, and geographic considerations. The development
should not damage the scenic values for which the park was
created. It should, nevertheless, be so situated that the skier
could enjoy that scenery without going far beyond the areas
in which utilities were available; otherwise, the facilities would
be used primarily by persons who wanted only to ski and not
to enjoy the Yosemite scene. Such persons could be better accommodated
elsewhere. The area developed for skiing should
not be so close to the valley rim as to be dangerous. From the
concessionaire&rsquo;s standpoint, the development should make use
of, and not duplicate, hotel facilities already available; otherwise,
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
it would not be worth the financial risk. Where the Park
Service was concerned, economically, it should be close enough
to the valley not to require excessive road maintenance and
snow removal and should not be too difficult to administer, for
the Park Service, after all, could only spend what Congress
appropriated in the annual budget. As for the man who skied
in Yosemite for the sake of skiing, his wants were simple. In
the aggregate, he wanted high and low cost accommodations
built at an elevation where the best snow lay the longest and
the slopes were most open; he wanted satisfactory uphill transportation
to enable him to spend most of his time and energy
sliding down; he wanted cleared runs and marked trails, outlying
huts for touring, and excellent ski instruction patterned
after the best European ski schools. He wanted ski competition
scheduled, and long courses on which to race. He, moreover,
wanted all this in a quantity that would take care of four thousand
or more skiers on a week end, without overcrowding the
facilities or overburdening his purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could the National Park Service do? The development
at Badger Pass was the result. The ski house, upski, rope
tows, Constam lift, the runs of various types, the ski school,
the cleared roads and parking area, the ranger ski patrol, the
marked touring trails, and the touring hut at Ostrander Lake
are all part of a development that is compatible with the national
park concept. Improvements will inevitably follow. In
the development so far, full enjoyment has been provided for
the tens of thousands of skiers who, although they like improvements,
would still prefer that the administrators of the national
parks continue to make haste slowly in any attempt to improve
upon the natural scene.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>HOTELS AND THEIR KEEPERS</i></h2>
<p>The early public interest manifested in the scenic beauties
of Yosemite prompted a few far-sighted local men of the
mountains to prepare for the influx of travelers that they felt
was bound to occur. J. M. Hutchings had no more than related
his experiences of his first visit in 1855 before Milton and Huston
Mann undertook the improvement of the old Mariposa
Indian trail leading to the valley. The next year Bunnell developed
a trail from the north side of the gorge. The first visitors
were from the camps of the Southern Mines, chiefly, but
there were a few from San Francisco and interior towns, as
well. During those first years of travel the few visitors expected
to &ldquo;rough it&rdquo;; they were men and women accustomed to the
wilds, and comforts were hardly required. Yet those pioneer
hotelkeepers who had provided crude shelters found that their
establishments were patronized. Hotelkeeping takes a place
very near the beginning of the Yosemite story.</p>
<p>The valley was then public domain. Although unsurveyed,
it was generally conceded that homesteads within it might be
claimed by whosoever persevered in establishing rights. The
prospect of great activity in developing Fr&eacute;mont&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mariposa
Estate&rdquo; caused certain citizens of Mariposa to turn their attention
to Yosemite Valley as the source of a much-needed water
supply. Bunnell reveals that commercial interests had designs
upon the valley as early as 1855. A survey of the valley and the
canyon below was made in that year by L. H. Bunnell and
George K. Peterson with the idea of making a reservoir.</p>

<p class="pcap">The Lower Hotel, 1856-1869</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The first house to be constructed there was built in 1856 by
the company interested in this water project. Bunnell states:
&ldquo;It was of white cedar &lsquo;puncheons,&rsquo; plank split out of logs. The
builders of it supposed that a claim in the valley would doubly
secure the water privileges. We made this building our headquarters,
covering the roof with our tents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first permanent hotel structure was also started that
year. It became known as the &ldquo;Lower Hotel.&rdquo; During the next
decade it and the Upper Hotel found no competitors. At the
close of the &rsquo;sixties, however, the hotel business of Yosemite
Valley flashed rather prominently in the commerce of the
state.</p>
<p>A volume might be written on the efforts of honest proprietors
to serve the early tourist; on the scheming of less scrupulous
claimants to capitalize on their Yosemite holdings; on
the humorous reaction of unsuspecting visitors within the
early hostelries; and, finally, on the story of later-day developments
which now care for the throng that, annually, partakes
of Yosemite offerings. The full history of Yosemite hotels is
eminently worth the telling, but the present work will be content
in pointing to interesting recorded incidents in the story.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Lower Hotel</span></h3>
<p>Messrs. Walworth and Hite were the first to venture in serving
the Yosemite public. Hite was a member of that family whose
fortune was made from the golden treasure of a mine at Hite&rsquo;s
Cove. Walworth seems to have left no record of his affairs or
connections. The partners selected a site opposite Yosemite
Falls, very near the area that had been occupied by Captain
Boling&rsquo;s camp in 1851, and set up their hotel of planks split
from pine logs. The building, started in 1856, was not completed
until the next year, and in the meantime a second
establishment was started near the present Sentinel Bridge, so
the first became, quite naturally, the &ldquo;Lower Hotel.&rdquo; Cunningham
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
and Beardsley, the same Beardsley who packed Weed&rsquo;s
camera in 1859, elected to finish construction of the Lower
Hotel, and they employed Mr. and Mrs. John H. Neal to run
it for them. J. C. Holbrook, the first to preach a sermon in
Yosemite, writes of his stop with Mrs. Neal in 1859: &ldquo;I secured
a bed, such as it was, for my wife, in a rough board shanty
occupied by a family that had arrived a few days before to
keep a sort of tavern, the woman being the only one within
fifty or sixty miles of the place. For myself, a bed of shavings
and a blanket under the branches of some trees formed my
resting place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A London parson in his <i>To San Francisco and Back</i>, of the
late &rsquo;sixties, offers the following description of his visit to this
earliest of Yosemite hotels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are in it [the valley] two hotels, as they call themselves,
but the accommodation is very rough. When G&mdash;&mdash; and I were
shown to our bedroom the first night we found that it consisted of
a quarter of a shed screened off by split planks, which rose about
eight or ten feet from the ground, and enabled us to hear everything
that went on in the other &ldquo;rooms,&rdquo; which were simply stalls in the
same shed. Ours had no window, but we could see the stars through
the roof. The door, opening out into the forest, was fastened with
cow-hinges of skin with the hair on, and a little leather strap which
hooked on to a nail. We boasted a rough, gaping floor, but several
of the other bedrooms were only strewed with branches of arbor
vitae. As a grizzly bear had lately been seen wandering about a few
hundred yards from our &ldquo;hotel,&rdquo; we took the precaution of putting
our revolvers under our pillows. I dare say this was needless as the
bears have mostly retired to the upper part of the valley, a few miles
off, but it gave a finish to our toilet which had the charm of novelty.
Next morning, however, seeing the keeper of the ranch with his
six-shooter in his hand, and noticing that it was heavily loaded, I
asked him why he used so much powder. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve loaded
it for bears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first G&mdash;&mdash; and I were the only visitors at this house, but
several were at the other one about half a mile off, and more were
soon expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Cunningham, A. G. Black, P. Longhurst, and G. F. Leidig
all took their turn at operating the crude establishment. It was
under the management of Black when Clarence King arrived
on his pioneer trip with the Geological Survey of California,
and one Longhurst apparently even then anticipated future
proprietorship by engaging in guiding its guests about the
valley. King describes Longhurst as &ldquo;a weather-beaten round-the-worlder,
whose function in the party was to tell yarns, sing
songs, and feed the inner man.&rdquo; His account, in <i>Mountaineering
in the Sierra Nevada</i>, continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had chosen, as the head-quarters of the survey, two little
cabins under the pine-trees near Black&rsquo;s Hotel. [Black was then
owner of the Lower Hotel.] They were central; they offered us
a shelter; and from their doors, which opened almost upon the
Merced itself, we obtained a most delightful sunrise view of the
Yosemite.</p>
<p>Next morning, in spite of early outcries from Longhurst, and a
warning solo of his performed with spoon and fry-pan, we lay in
our comfortable blankets pretending to enjoy the effect of sunrise
light upon the Yosemite cliff and fall, all of us unwilling to own
that we were tired out and needed rest. Breakfast had waited an
hour or more when we got a little weary of beds and yielded to the
temptation of appetite.</p>
<p>A family of Indians, consisting of two huge girls and their parents,
sat silently waiting for us to commence, and, after we had
begun, watched every mouthful from the moment we got it successfully
impaled upon the camp forks, a cloud darkening their faces
as it disappeared forever down our throats.</p>
<p>But we quite lost our spectators when Longhurst came upon the
boards as a flapjack-frier, a r&ocirc;le to which he bent his whole intelligence,
and with entire success. Scorning such vulgar accomplishment
as turning the cake over in mid-air, he slung it boldly up,
turning it three times, ostentatiously greasing the pan with a fine
centrifugal movement, and catching the flapjack as it fluttered
down, and spanked it upon the hot coals with a touch at once graceful
and masterly.</p>
<p>I failed to enjoy these products, feeling as if I were breakfasting
in sacrilege upon works of art. Not so our Indian friends, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
wrestled affectionately for frequent unfortunate cakes which would
dodge Longhurst and fall into the ashes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1869 A. G. Black tore down the Lower Hotel and on its
site constructed the rambling building which became known
as &ldquo;Black&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Upper Hotel</span></h3>
<p>Prior to their interest in the Lower Hotel, S. M. Cunningham
and Buck Beardsley had essayed to start a store and tent shelter
on the later site of the Cedar Cottage. Cunningham, of later Big
Tree fame, dropped this venture; so Beardsley united with G.
Hite and in the fall of 1857 began the preparation of the timbers
which made the frame of the Cedar Cottage. Mechanical
sawmills had not yet been brought so far into the wilderness,
and the partners whipsawed and hewed every plank, rafter, and
joist in the building. It was ready for occupancy in May, 1859.</p>
<p>The proprietors of the Upper Hotel fared none too well
in the returns forthcoming from guests. Ownership changed
hands a number of times, and business dwindled to a point of
absolute suspension. In 1864 it was possible for J. M. Hutchings
to purchase the building and the land claim adjoining for
a very nominal price. At this time the proposed state park was
being widely talked of, and, as a matter of fact, Hutchings
stepped into the ownership of the Upper Hotel property but
a few months before the Yosemite Valley was removed from the
public domain and granted to the state to be &ldquo;inalienable for
all time.&rdquo; Mr. Hutchings was, and is to this day, sharply criticized
by some citizens for his presumption in purchasing public
lands that had not been officially surveyed. Whatever may
have been his legal claim, it must be admitted that his was
the moral right to expect compensation for the expenditure
of thousands of dollars for physical improvements made upon
his Yosemite property.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Hutchings brought his family to the Upper Hotel in 1864
and assumed a proprietorship that awakened lengthy comments
from many of his journalistic guests. Being well educated,
a great lover of nature, a journalist himself, and blessed
with a generous share of sentiment, it can be understood why
some of his guests felt that &ldquo;there are better things which he
could do better.&rdquo; Testimonies agree that if he was not a huge
success as a resort manager, his rich fund of information and
hospitable enthusiasm more than compensated for his defects.</p>
<p>Charles Loring Brace visited Yosemite a few years after
Hutchings became a local character there. He stopped at the
Hutchings House and later wrote about his experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the jokes current in the Valley is to carefully warn the
traveler, before coming to this hotel, &ldquo;not to leave his bed-room
door unlocked, as there are thieves about!&rdquo; On retiring to his room
for the night, he discovers to his amazement, that his door is a sheet,
and his partition from the adjoining sleeping-chamber also a cotton
cloth. The curtain-lectures and bed-room conversations conducted
under these circumstances, it may be judged, are discreet. The
house, however, is clean, and the table excellent; and Hutchings
himself, enough of a character alone to make up for innumerable
deficiencies. He is one of the original pioneers of the Valley, and
at the same time is a man of considerable literary abilities, and a
poet. He has written a very creditable guidebook on the Canyon.
No one could have a finer appreciation of the points of beauty, and
the most characteristic scenes of the Valley. He is a &ldquo;Guide&rdquo; in the
highest sense, and loves the wonderful region which he shows yearly
to strangers from every quarter of the world. But, unfortunately,
he is also hotel-keeper, waiter, and cook&mdash;employments requiring
a good deal of close, practical attention, as earthly life is arranged.
Thus we come down, very hungry, to a delicious breakfast of fresh
trout, venison, and great pans of garden strawberries; but, unfortunately,
there are no knives and forks. A romantic young lady
asks, in an unlucky moment, about the best point of view for the
Yosemite Fall. &ldquo;Madam, there is but one; you must get close to the
Upper Fall, just above the mist of the lower, and there you will see
a horizontal rainbow beneath your feet, and the most exquisite&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here a strong-minded lady, whose politeness is at an end, &ldquo;But
here, Hutchings, we have no knives and forks!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, beg a thousand
pardons, madam!&rdquo; and he rushes off; but meeting his wife on
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
the way, she gives him coffee for the English party, and he forgets
us entirely, and we get up good-naturedly and search out the implements
ourselves. Again, from an amiable lady, &ldquo;Please, Mr.
Hutchings, another cup of coffee!&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly, Madam!&rdquo; When the
English lady from Calcutta asks him about some wild flowers, he
goes off in a botanical and poetical disquisition, and in his abstraction
brings the other lady, with great eagerness, a glass of water.
Sometimes sugar is handed you instead of salt for the trout, or cold
water is poured into your coffee; but none of the ladies mind, for
our landlord is as handsome as he is obliging, and really full of
information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maria Teresa Longworth, known as Therese Yelverton, Viscountess
Avonmore, visited Yosemite in 1870, where she wrote
<i>Zanita: A Tale of the Yosemite</i>, published in 1872. She made
the Hutchings&rsquo; entourage a part of her melodrama, and Florence,
eldest daughter of the Hutchingses, was the heroine,
&ldquo;Zanita.&rdquo; John Muir, of whom in real life the Viscountess was
enamored, was the hero, &ldquo;Kenmuir.&rdquo; A good analysis of Yelverton&rsquo;s
relationships, actual and fictional, with the Hutchings
family and the other pioneer residents of the valley is contained
in Linnie Marsh Wolfe&rsquo;s great book, <i>Son of the Wilderness</i>.</p>
<p>Not all of the Hutchings House features were within its
walls. J. D. Caton, who availed himself of the Hutchings hospitality
in 1870, &ldquo;walked over to the foot of the Yosemite Falls
and lingered by the way to pick a market basket full of enormous
strawberries in Hutchings&rsquo; garden.&rdquo; One of the first acts
of the homesteaders was to plant an orchard and cultivate the
above-mentioned strawberry patch. The strawberries long ago
disappeared, but many of the one hundred and fifty apple trees
still thrive and provide fruit for permanent Yosemite residents.</p>
<p>During his regime of ownership, Hutchings added Rock
Cottage, Oak Cottage, and River Cottage to his caravansary.
In 1874 the state legislature appropriated $60,000 to extinguish
all private claims in Yosemite Valley, and the Hutchings interests
were adjudged to be entitled to $24,000.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Coulter and Murphy then became the proprietors of the old
Hutchings group and in 1876 they built the Sentinel Hotel.
Their period of management was brief, and the entire property
passed to J. K. Barnard in 1877, who for seventeen years
maintained it as the Yosemite Falls Hotel.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> This unit among
the pioneer hostelries was torn down in 1938-1940.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Clark&rsquo;s Ranch, Now Wawona</span></h3>
<p>Galen Clark accompanied one of the 1855 Yosemite-bound
parties that had been inspired by Hutchings, when that pioneer
related his experiences in Mariposa. Upon his first trip
to the valley over the old Indian trail from Mariposa, he recognized
in the meadows on the South Fork of the Merced a most
promising place of abode. His health had been impaired in the
gold camps; he had, in fact, been told by a physician that he
could live but a short time. The lovely vale of the Nuchu Indians
offered solace, and in April of 1857 he settled there on
the site of the camp occupied by the Mariposa Battalion in
1851. Nowhere in his writings does Clark intimate that he expected
to be overtaken by early death at the time of his homesteading.
Rather we may believe that it was with foresight and
careful plan that he erected his cabin beside the new trail of
the sight-seer and prepared to accommodate those saddle-weary
pilgrims who mounted horses at Mariposa and made their first
stop with him en route to the new mecca.</p>
<p>His first cabin was crude. A rough pine table surrounded
by three-legged stools facilitated his homely service. As the
number of visitors increased, Clark enlarged his ranch house.
When ten years of his pioneer hotel keeping had passed,
Charles Loring Brace was among his visitors. Brace writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After fourteen miles&mdash;an easy ride&mdash;we all reached Clark&rsquo;s Ranch
at a late hour, ready for supper and bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>This ranch is a long, rambling, low house, built under enormous
sugar-pines, where travelers find excellent quarters and rest in their
journey to the Valley. Clark himself is evidently a character; one
of those men one frequently meets in California&mdash;the modern anchorite&mdash;a
hater of civilization and a lover of the forest&mdash;handsome,
thoughtful, interesting, and slovenly. In his cabin were some of the
choicest modern books and scientific surveys; the walls were lined
with beautiful photographs of the Yosemite; he knew more than
any of his guests of the fauna, flora, and geology of the State; he
conversed well on any subject, and was at once philosopher, savant,
chambermaid, cook, and landlord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the scores of books written by early Yosemite visitors,
one might extract a great compendium of remarks on Clark
and his ranch. The proprietor, like the Grizzly Giant, was impressive.
He was invariably remembered by his guests. They
wrote of his generous hospitality, his simplicity, kindness, honesty,
wit, wisdom, and unselfish devotion to the mountains he
loved. Had they known, they might have written that he gave
too freely of all his mental and physical assets and that as a
businessman he was not a success. The season of 1870 found
the ownership of his ranch divided with Edwin Moore.</p>
<p>Moore assumed general management, and Clark&rsquo;s became
known as &ldquo;Clark and Moore&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The ladies of Moore&rsquo;s family
introduced a new element in the hospitality of the place, and
for a few years it assumed an aspect of new ambition. Extensive
improvements, however, resulted in foreclosure of mortgages,
and the firm of Washburn, Coffman, and Chapman secured
ownership in 1875 and changed the name to &ldquo;Wawona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. P. Vivian stopped at Wawona in January, 1878, and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although still called a &ldquo;ranche,&rdquo; this establishment has long
ceased to be mainly concerned with agriculture. Clark himself
exists no longer, at any rate in this locality; that individual sold his
interests some years ago to Messrs. Washburn, who &ldquo;run the stage,&rdquo;
and are now the &ldquo;bosses of the route&rdquo; between this and Merced.
The ranche is now a small but comfortable and roomy inn, and
during the tourists&rsquo; season is filled to overflowing.</p>
<p>Besides having constructed the twenty-five miles of capital road
hence into the Yosemite Valley, Messrs. Washburn are again showing
their enterprise by making a road direct to Merced, the object
of which is to save thirty miles over the present Mariposa route.</p>

known family resorts in the Sierra Nevada and retains
some of the flavor of its earlier years.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Black&rsquo;s Hotel</span></h3>
<p>A. G. Black was a pioneer of the Coulterville region. In the
late &rsquo;fifties, he resided at Bull Creek on the Coulterville trail.
Visitors who entered the valley from the north during the first
years of tourist travel have left a few records of stops made at
the &ldquo;Black&rsquo;s&rdquo; of that place. The &ldquo;Black&rsquo;s&rdquo; of Yosemite Valley
did not come into existence until the advent of the &rsquo;sixties,
when Mrs. Black is reported to have purchased the old Lower
Hotel. In 1869 this first structure was torn down, and an
elongated shedlike structure built on its site, near the foot of
the present Four-Mile Trail to Glacier Point. This was the
&ldquo;Black&rsquo;s&rdquo; that for nineteen years served a goodly number of
Yosemite tourists. In 1888, after the opening of the Stoneman
House, there was among the commissioners &ldquo;a unanimity of
feeling that the old shanties and other architectural bric-a-brac,
that had long done service for hotels and stables, and the like,
should be torn down.&rdquo; Black&rsquo;s Hotel was accordingly removed
in the fall of 1888, and the lumber from its sagging walls went
into the construction of the &ldquo;Kenneyville&rdquo; property, which
stood on the present site of the Ahwahnee Hotel.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Leidig&rsquo;s</span></h3>
<p>The family of George F. Leidig arrived in Yosemite Valley in
1866. For a time the old Lower Hotel was in their charge, but,
when its owner, A. G. Black, assumed its management personally,
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
the Leidigs secured rights to build for themselves. They
selected a site just west of the old establishment and constructed
a two-story building to become known as Leidig&rsquo;s. This was in
1869. Charles T. Leidig, the first white boy to be born in the
valley, was born in the spring of that year.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leidig&rsquo;s ability as a cook was quickly noted by visitors,
and, no doubt, the popularity of her table did much to draw
patrons. Many are the printed comments in the contemporary
publications of her guests. Here is an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leidig&rsquo;s is the best place in the line of hotels. Mrs. L&mdash;&mdash; attends
to the cooking in person; the results are that the food is well cooked
and intelligently served. There is not the variety to be obtained
here as in places more accessible to market. After traveling a few
months in California, a person is liable to think less of variety and
more of quality. At this place the beds are cleanly and wholesome,
although consisting of pulu mattresses placed upon slat bedsteads.
This house stands in the shadow of Sentinel Rock, and faces the
great Yosemite Fall; is surrounded with porches, making a pleasant
place to sit and contemplate the magnificence of the commanding
scenery. (From Caroline M. Churchill, 1876.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When A. P. Vivian continued on to Yosemite in January of
1878, he found the Leidig family in the valley and commented
as follows on his winter reception:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our host was glad enough to see us, for tourists are very scarce
commodities at this time of the year, and he determined to celebrate
our arrival by exploding a dynamite cartridge, that we might
at the same time enjoy the grand echoes. These were doubtless extraordinary,
but I am free to confess I would rather have gone away
without hearing them than have experienced the anxiety of mind,
and real risk to body, which preceded the pleasure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leidig&rsquo;s, with Black&rsquo;s, was torn down after the Stoneman
House provided more fitting accommodations. The little
chapel which had been built near these old hotels in 1879 was
moved to its present site in the Old Village. In 1928 the picturesque
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
old well platform and crane, which had marked the
Leidig site, was destroyed. Only a group of locust trees now
indicates where this center of pioneer activity existed.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Cosmopolitan, 1872-1932</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>But the wonder&mdash;among the buildings of Yosemite&mdash;is the &ldquo;Cosmopolitan,&rdquo;
containing saloon, billiard hall, bathing rooms, and
barber-shop, established and kept by Mr. C. E. Smith. Everything
in it was transported twenty miles on mules; mirrors full-length,
pyramids of elaborate glassware, costly service, the finest of cues
and tables, reading-room handsomely furnished and supplied with
the latest from Eastern cities, and baths with unexceptionable surroundings,
attest the nerve and energy of the projector. It is a perfect
gem. The end of the wagon-road was twenty miles away when
the enterprise began, and yet such skill was used in mule-packing
that not an article was broken. I have not seen a finer place of resort,
for its size. The arrangements for living are such that one could
spend the summer there delightfully, and we found several tourists
who remained for weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foregoing from J. H. Beadle is but one of scores of enthusiastic
outbursts from amazed tourists who wrote of their
Yosemite experiences. To say that C. E. Smith figured in early
Yosemite affairs is hardly expressive. His baths, his drinks, and
the various unexpected comforts provided by his Cosmopolitan
left lasting impressions that vied with El Capitan when it
came to securing space in books written by visitors. The ladies
exclaimed over the cleanliness of the bathtubs; a profusion
of towels, fine and coarse; delicate toilet soaps, bay rum, Florida
water, arnica, court plaster; needles, thread, and buttons;
and late copies of the <i>Alta</i> and the <i>Bulletin</i> for fresh &ldquo;bustles.&rdquo;
The men found joy in &ldquo;a running accompaniment of &lsquo;brandy-cocktails,&rsquo;
&lsquo;gin-slings,&rsquo; &lsquo;barber&rsquo;s poles,&rsquo; &lsquo;eye-openers,&rsquo; &lsquo;mint-julep,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Samson with the hair on,&rsquo; &lsquo;corpse-revivers,&rsquo; &lsquo;rattlesnakes,&rsquo; and
other potent combinations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cosmopolitan boasted of a certain Grand Register, a
foot in thickness, morocco-bound, and mounted with silver.
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
Within it were the autographs and comments of thousands of
visitors both great and lowly. The relic is now a part of the
Yosemite Museum collection.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Tommy Hall, the pioneer barber of Yosemite, found sumptuous
quarters in the Cosmopolitan. The old building continued
to house a barber shop until it was destroyed by fire on
December 8, 1932.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">La Casa Nevada</span></h3>
<p>For fifteen years after the coming of visitors, the wonders of
the Merced Canyon above Happy Isles were accessible only
to those hardy mountaineers who could scramble through the
boulder-strewn gorge without the advantage of a true trail.
In 1869-70 one Albert Snow completed a horse trail from
Yosemite Valley to the flat between Vernal and Nevada falls,
and there opened a mountain chalet, which was to be known
as &ldquo;La Casa Nevada.&rdquo; The popularity of the saddle trip to the
two great falls of the Merced was immediate, and the pioneer
trail builder, John Conway, extended the trail from Snow&rsquo;s
to Little Yosemite Valley the next year. It then was usual for
all tourists to ascend the Merced Canyon to La Casa Nevada
and Little Yosemite. Some hikers undertook the trip from Little
Yosemite to Glacier Point, but another fifteen years were to
elapse before Glacier Point was made accessible by a truly good
horse trail from Nevada Fall.</p>
<p>Snow&rsquo;s was opened on April 28, 1870. One of the prized possessions
of the Yosemite Museum is a register from this hostelry,
which dates from the opening to 1875. Upon its foxed pages
appear thousands of registrations and numerous comments
of more than passing interest. Among these is a very interesting
two-page manuscript by John Muir, describing an 1874
trip to Snow&rsquo;s via Glacier Point and the Illilouette. P. A. H.
Laurence, once editor of the <i>Mariposa Gazette</i>, contributed
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
to its value by inscribing within it an account of his visit to
Yosemite Valley in 1855, years before the chalet was built.</p>
<p>A party with N. H. Davis, United States Inspector General,
commented upon their destination and added: &ldquo;This party
defers further remarks until some further examinations are
made.&rdquo; Under the date of the original entry is a significant
second autograph by a member of the General&rsquo;s party: &ldquo;A
preliminary examination develops an abundance of mountain
dew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great pile of broken containers, which had once held the
&ldquo;mountain dew,&rdquo; is about the only remnant of La Casa Nevada
which may be viewed by present-day visitors, for the chalet was
destroyed by fire in the early &rsquo;nineties.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Peregoy&rsquo;s</span></h3>
<p>Another pioneer hotel is represented in the Yosemite Museum
collections by a register.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> It was known as the Mountain View
House and occupied a strategic spot on the old horse trail from
Clark&rsquo;s to Yosemite Valley. Its site is known to present-day visitors
as Peregoy Meadows, and the remains of the log building
now repose quite as they fell many years ago. The hospitality
of its keepers, Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Peregoy, was utilized by
those travelers who, coming from Clark&rsquo;s, took lunch there, or
by those who departed from the valley via Glacier Point and
made it an overnight stopping place.</p>
<p>The Mountain View House register indicates that guests
were entertained as early as the fall of 1869. It was not, however,
until the spring of 1870 that the little resort made a bid
for patronage. Its capacity for overnight accommodation was
sixteen; so it is not surprising that a number of writers of the
&rsquo;seventies were forced to record, in their published Yosemite
memoirs, that they arrived late and sat around the kitchen
stove all night. In June of 1872, fifty-six tourists were overtaken
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
by a snowstorm in the neighborhood of Peregoy&rsquo;s. It is to be
surmised that on that night even the little kitchen did not
accommodate the overflow.</p>
<p>The construction of the Wawona road in 1875 revised the
route of all Yosemite travel south of the Merced. Peregoy&rsquo;s was
left far from the line of travel and no longer functioned in the
scheme of Yosemite resorts.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Harris Camp Grounds</span></h3>
<p>By 1878, the demand for recognition of private camping parties
introduced the idea of public camp grounds in Yosemite.
Large numbers of visitors were bringing their own conveyances
and camping equipment so as to be independent of the
hostelries. The commissioners set aside a part of the old Lamon
property in the vicinity of the present Ahwahnee Hotel as the
grounds upon which to accommodate the new class of visitors.
Mr. A. Harris was granted the right to administer to the wants
of the campers. He grew fodder for their animals, offered stable
facilities, sold provisions, and rented equipment. The Harris
Camp Ground was the forerunner of the present-day housekeeping
camps and public auto camps, which accommodate,
by far, the greater number of Yosemite visitors.</p>
<p>An exceedingly interesting register, kept for the comments
of campers of that day, was recently presented to the Yosemite
Museum by the descendants of Harris. For ten years Yosemite
campers recorded their ideas of Yosemite, its management, and
particularly the kindness of Harris, upon its pages. The following
is representative:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lr">Yosemite Valley,</p>
<p class="lr">Tuesday, July 20th, 1880</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We have tented in the Valley and been contented too.</p>

<p class="t0">For &rsquo;tis the kind that rhymsters make to peddle by the mile.</p>
<p class="lr">W B L</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be said that from the Harris service grew the idea of
camp rental, which was first practiced by the commissioners in
1898 and is now a recognized business of the housekeeping-camps
department of the present operators in the park.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Glacier Point Mountain House</span></h3>
<p>After the construction of Snow&rsquo;s trail to Little Yosemite in
1871, some good mountaineers made the Glacier Point trip
via Little Yosemite and the Illilouette basin. Prior to this time,
J. M. Hutchings had been guiding parties of hikers to the
famous Point over a most hazardous trail, which he had blazed
up the Ledge and through the Chimney. Occasional references
to a shack at Glacier Point indicate that Peregoy had made
some attempt to locate there about the same time that his
Mountain View House of Peregoy Meadows was opened for
business. However, the real claim for Glacier Point patronage
came from one James McCauley, who in 1870-1871 met the
expense of building a horse trail from Black&rsquo;s and Leidig&rsquo;s over
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
a four-mile route up the 3,200-foot cliff to the famous vantage
point. This new route was at first a toll trail. For sixty years it
has been climbed and descended by countless thousands of
riders and hikers. It has been known as the Four-Mile Trail
for more than half a century, and it was not until 1929 that its
grades, surveyed and built by John Conway, were changed by
more skilled engineers.</p>
<p>It is likely that McCauley, owner of the Four-Mile Trail,
made use of the insufficient little building on Glacier Point
while his trail was in the making. Few records regarding the
&ldquo;shack&rdquo; or his later Mountain House are to be found, but Lady
C. F. Gordon-Cumming wrote on the tenth of May, 1878: &ldquo;The
snow on the upper trail [Four-Mile] had been cleared by men
who are building a rest-house on the summit.&rdquo; After arriving
at Glacier Point, she records: &ldquo;The cold breeze was so biting
that we were thankful to take refuge, with our luncheon-basket,
in the newly built wooden house.&rdquo; Later, &ldquo;On our way
down through the snow-cuttings, we had rather an awkward
meeting with a long file of mules heavily laden with furniture&mdash;or
rather, portions of furniture&mdash;for the new house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is believed that the first firefall from Glacier Point was
the work of James McCauley in 1871 or 1872. He sold his trail
to the state. His Mountain House was operated on a lease
basis from the commissioners. One of his visitors of the early
&rsquo;eighties was Derrick Dodd, who concocted something of a
classic in the way of Glacier Point stories. It is too good to pass
into oblivion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smaller">DERRICK DODD&rsquo;S TOUGH STORY</span></p>
<p>As a part of the usual programme, we experimented as to the time
taken by different objects in reaching the bottom of the cliff. An
ordinary stone tossed over remained in sight an incredibly long
time, but finally vanished somewhere about the middle distance. A
handkerchief with a stone tied in the corner, was visible perhaps a
thousand feet deeper; but even an empty box, watched by a field-glass,
could not be traced to its concussion with the Valley floor.
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
Finally, the landlord appeared on the scene, carrying an antique
hen under his arm. This, in spite of the terrified ejaculations and
entreaties of the ladies, he deliberately threw over the cliff&rsquo;s edge. A
rooster might have gone thus to his doom in stoic silence, but the sex
of this unfortunate bird asserted itself the moment it started on its
awful journey into space. With an ear-piercing cackle that gradually
grew fainter as it fell, the poor creature shot downward; now
beating the air with ineffectual wings, and now frantically clawing
at the very wind, that slanted her first this way and then that; thus
the hapless fowl shot down, down, until it became a mere fluff of
feathers no larger than a quail. Then it dwindled to a wren&rsquo;s size,
disappeared, then again dotted the sight a moment as a pin&rsquo;s point,
and then&mdash;it was gone!</p>
<p>After drawing a long breath all round, the women folks pitched
into the hen&rsquo;s owner with redoubled zest. But the genial McCauley
shook his head knowingly, and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed about that chicken, ladies. She&rsquo;s used to it.
She goes over that cliff every day during the season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, sure enough, on our road back we met the old hen about
half up the trail, calmly picking her way home!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1882, the Glacier Point road was built. Traffic to the
Mountain House was, of course, doubled by the coming of
those who would not walk or ride a horse up steep trails. Glacier
Point trails did not fall into disuse, however. On the contrary,
attempts were made to make them more attractive. Anderson&rsquo;s
Trail from Happy Isles to Vernal Fall was constructed at great
loss to its builder in 1882. The present Eleven-Mile Trail from
Nevada Fall to Glacier Point was built in 1885. In spite of the
variety of routes offered, it was planned as early as 1887 to
provide a passenger lift to the famous vantage-point. The plan
progressed as far as the making of a preliminary survey. Accommodations
at the point remained unchanged until 1917, when
the Glacier Point Hotel was built by the Desmond Park Service
Company adjacent to the Mountain House. The two structures
function as a unit of the Yosemite Park and Curry Company
operation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h3><span class="sc">The John Degnan Bakery and Store</span></h3>
<p>The Degnan concession in the &ldquo;Old Village&rdquo; is not and never
was a hotel or lodge. However, it has catered to Yosemite tourists
since 1884 and is the oldest business in the park. John
Degnan, an Irishman, built his first Yosemite cabin on the site
of the present Degnan store. Soon thereafter, on the occasion
of a spring meeting of the Yosemite Valley Commissioners, of
which the governor of the state was a member, Mr. Degnan
appeared before the managing body to obtain the privilege
of building a suitable home. The board listened to his plea,
and the Governor observed, &ldquo;He seems to be the kind of man
we want as an all-year resident&mdash;one who will take care of
the place when it needs care.&rdquo; Mr. Degnan, in an interview with
a National Park Service official in 1941, stated, &ldquo;After that
meeting the Commissioners came over to my cabin, and the
Governor then assigned to me the land which I now occupy,
extending from the road to the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Degnan, who was a party to all of Mr. Degnan&rsquo;s pioneering
in Yosemite Valley, met the tourists&rsquo; demand for bread.
Gradually, her bakery expanded until her ovens could turn out
one hundred loaves at a baking. The business and the home
grew as did the Degnan family. Mary Ellen Degnan, one of
the several children born to Mr. and Mrs. Degnan, now manages
the modern store and restaurant which evolved from the
pioneer venture.</p>
<p>The record of John Degnan&rsquo;s activities in Yosemite National
Park stands as ample testimony to the accuracy of the governor&rsquo;s
appraisal, &ldquo;He seems to be the kind of man we want.&rdquo; He
was a respected party to much of the early physical improvement
in and about the valley and to the general growth and
development of facilities and services.</p>
<p>Mrs. Degnan died Dec. 17, 1940, and Mr. Degnan&rsquo;s death
occurred on Feb. 27, 1943.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h3><span class="sc">The Stoneman House</span></h3>
<p>The demand for more pretentious accommodations than those
afforded by the pioneer hotels of Yosemite was met in 1887,
when the state built a four-story structure that would accommodate
about 150 guests. The legislature in 1885 appropriated
$40,000 to be expended on this building. Another $5,000
was secured for water supply and furniture. A site near the
present Camp Curry garage was selected, and the building contract
let to Carle, Croly, and Abernethy. Upon its completion
J. J. Cook, who had been managing Black&rsquo;s Hotel, was placed
in charge.</p>
<p>The bulky structure was not beautiful architecturally, and
the first few years of its existence demonstrated that its design
was faulty. In 1896 the Stoneman House burned to the ground.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Camp Curry</span></h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. D. A. Curry originated an idea in tourist service
which rather revolutionized the scheme of hostelry operation
in Yosemite and other national parks. The Currys came to
Yosemite in 1899. They were teachers who had turned their
summer vacations into profitable management of Western
camping tours in such localities as Yellowstone National Park.
Their first venture in Yosemite involved use of seven tents and
employment of one paid woman cook. The services of several
college students were secured in return for summer expenses.
The site chosen for that first camp is the area occupied by
Camp Curry.</p>
<p>Success of the hotel-camp plan was immediately apparent.
The first year 292 people registered at the resort. However, success
was not attained without striving. The camp was dependent
upon freight-wagon service requiring two weeks to make
the round trip to Merced. Sometimes even this service failed.</p>
<p>Informal hospitality has always characterized Camp Curry.
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
Popular campfire entertainments have been a feature from the
beginning. In one of the first summers in Yosemite, D. A. Curry
revived the firefall,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> which it is presumed originated with James
McCauley, of the Mountain House. Employees from Camp
Curry were occasionally sent to Glacier Point to build a fire
and push it off for a special party. This was done more and
more frequently, until it became a nightly occurrence. Mr.
Curry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; his &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; delivered with
remarkable volume, won for him the appellation, &ldquo;The Stentor
of Yosemite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coming of the Yosemite Valley Railroad in 1907 gave
a powerful new impetus to the growth of Camp Curry. Automobile
travel, of course, provided the climax. In 1915 the camp
provided accommodations for one thousand visitors. Today, it
maintains nearly 500 tents and 200 bungalow and cabin rooms.</p>
<p>The successful operations of the Curry business induced
would-be competition. Camp Yosemite, later known as Camp
Lost Arrow, was started in 1901 near the foot of Yosemite Falls.
It continued to function until 1915. Camp Ahwahnee, at the
foot of the Four-Mile Trail, was established in 1908 and continued
for seven years. The Desmond Park Service Company
secured a twenty-year concession to operate camps, stores, and
transportation service in 1915. This company purchased the
assets of the Sentinel Hotel, Camp Lost Arrow, and Camp
Ahwahnee. The two camps were discontinued, and a new venture
made in the present Yosemite Lodge. The Desmond Company
prevailed until 1920, when reorganization took place, and
it became the Yosemite National Park Company.</p>
<p>The Curry Camping Company maintained its substantial
position through all of the years of varying fortunes of its less
substantial contemporaries. In 1925, the Yosemite Park and
Curry Company was formed by the consolidation of the Curry
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
Company and the Yosemite National Park Company. The new
organization has contracted with the government to perform
all services demanded by the public in the park. Some 1,250
people are employed during the summer months, and the investment
in tourist facilities totals $5,500,000.</p>
<p>David A. Curry did not live to witness the realization of all
his plans. However, prior to his death in 1917, the march of
progress had so advanced as to make evident the place of leadership
the Curry operation was to maintain. &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; Curry, as
&ldquo;Manager Emeritus,&rdquo; still devotes personal attention to the
business of the pioneer hotel-camp but the active management
is in the hands of persons trained by her and her daughter,
Mary Curry Tresidder. Her son-in-law, Dr. Donald B. Tresidder,
until 1943 actively managed the operations and still
retains the presidency of the extensive Yosemite Park and
Curry Company, which has grown from the modest start made
in 1899.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Big Trees Lodge</span></h3>
<p>The Yosemite National Park Company in 1920 established a
tent camp in the upper section of the Mariposa Grove, which
consisted of a rustic central building constructed around the
base of the tree, Montana, and a group of cabins and tents. The
camp persisted in this form until 1932, when it was razed
by the Yosemite Park and Curry Company, and a new lodge
was built near Sunset Point in the Grove. In its design the
new building reflects the charm of pioneer structures of the
Sierra Nevada.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">High Sierra Camps</span></h3>
<p>In 1923, Superintendent Lewis advocated the creation of a
service that would enable the hiker to enjoy the wonders of
the Yosemite high country and yet be free from the irksome
load of blankets and food necessary to the success of a trip away
from the established centers of the park. T. E. Farrow, of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
Yosemite Park Company, projected tentative plans for a series
of &ldquo;hikers&rsquo; camps,&rdquo; and in the fall of 1923 I was dispatched on
a journey of reconnaissance for the purpose of locating camp
sites in the rugged country drained by the headwaters of the
Merced and Tuolumne. The sites advocated were Little Yosemite,
Merced Lake,<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> Boothe Lake, the Lyell Fork (Mount
Lyell), Tuolumne Meadows,<a class="fn" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> Glen Aulin, and Tenaya Lake.<a class="fn" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>
In 1924, these sites, with the exception of Lyell Fork and Glen
Aulin, were occupied by simple camps, consisting of a mess
and cook tent, a dormitory tent for women, and a dormitory
tent for men. Attendants and cooks were employed for each
establishment. With two exceptions, the camps were removed
from roads, and equipment and supplies were of necessity
packed in on mules. Yet it was possible to offer the facilities of
these high mountain resorts at a very low price, and it became
apparent that saddle parties, as well as hikers, would take advantage
of them. Consequently they have become known as
High Sierra Camps.</p>
<p>The camp beside the White Cascade at Glen Aulin was established
in 1927 and has been very popular. In 1938, the Tenaya
Lake Camp was moved to a beautiful location in a grove of
hemlocks on May Lake, just east of Mount Hoffmann. New
trails were built to make this spot more readily accessible from
the Snow Creek Trail and from Glen Aulin. The Boothe
Lake Camp, after a few years of operation, was abandoned
in favor of a new camp near the junction of the Vogelsang,
Rafferty Creek, and Lyell Fork trails. In 1940, this camp was
rebuilt on the banks of Fletcher Creek. The Tuolumne Meadows
Lodge is now the only one of these camps situated on a
road. Each camp has a setting of a distinctive mountain character
on lake or stream. All the camps represent a joint effort
on the part of the National Park Service and the concessionaire
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
to encourage and assist travel beyond the roads, where the visitor
may appreciate the wild values of the park which he can
hardly observe from the highways.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Ahwahnee Hotel, 1927 to Date</span></h3>
<p>The Yosemite Park and Curry Company opened the Ahwahnee
in 1927. Its interior has received quite as much study as has its
exterior architectural values.</p>
<p>California Indian patterns have been used throughout the
hotel in many ways. In the lobby, six great figures, set in multiple
borders, rendered in mosaic, give color and interest to
the floor. In the downstairs corridor and the dining room,
other borders and simpler Indian motifs are rendered in acid-etched
cement. Painted Indian ornaments play a number of
different roles in the building.</p>
<p>In the main lounge the great beams have been related to the
contents of the room with borders, spots, and panels of Indian
motifs in the colors that appear in the rugs and furniture coverings,
while the entire mantel end of the room serves as a bond
between the ceiling and the floor with a composite of Indian
figures built into one great architectural structure. At the top
of each of the ten high windows is a panel of stained glass, each
one different, the series forming a rhythmical frieze that bands
the room. They are all composed of Indian patterns.</p>
<p>The arts of the whole world have been called together to
give the Ahwahnee character and color. There are Colonial
furniture, pottery, and textiles; furniture, cottons and linen,
lights, and a clock from England; cottons from Norway; and
irons from Flanders; more iron and furniture and fabrics from
France; embroideries from Italy; rugs from Spain; designs
from Greece and designs from Turkey; rugs, jars, and tiles, silks
and cottons from Persia; more rugs from the Caucasus and tent

terra cotta from Mexico, and so back to California,
whence comes the basic motif of the whole, the Indian design.</p>
<p>On June 23, 1943, the Ahwahnee Hotel was taken over by the
United States Navy and operated as a hospital. It functioned as
the Naval Special Hospital until its formal decommissioning
on December 15, 1945, and 6,752 patients were treated, the
greatest number at one time being 853. A large and varied
naval staff was assigned to duty at the Ahwahnee, including
officers, nurses, Waves, and enlisted men. Representatives of
the American Red Cross, Veterans&rsquo; Administration, and the
United States Employment Service also participated in the
hospital program. The Ahwahnee as a hospital became an
adequately equipped and functioning rehabilitation center,
capable of handling full programs of physical training, occupational
therapy, and educational work. The department of
occupational therapy, especially, was recognized as outstanding
among service hospitals. The program of rehabilitation
extended to the out-of-doors, both summer and winter.</p>

<br /><i>EAST-SIDE MINING EXCITEMENT</i></h2>
<p>Frequently each summer, those who climb to the Sierra
crest within the Yosemite National Park come upon the
remains of little &ldquo;cities&rdquo; near the mountaintops. Because the
story of these deserted towns, now within the boundaries of
the park is so interwoven with the story of Mono mining affairs
in general, this chapter will of necessity take some account of
the events of the Mono Basin, immediately east of Yosemite.</p>
<p>The first white men to visit the Mono country were undoubtedly
the American trappers, followed shortly afterward by the
explorers and immigrants. The first records of mineral finds
in this region, however, are those that pertain to Lieutenant
Tredwell Moore&rsquo;s Indian-fighting expedition to the Yosemite
in June, 1852 (see <a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>), which crossed the Sierra at the northern
Mono Pass and brought back samples of gold ore. The
miners who soon followed and, with a few others, continued
to work in the Mono region, were apparently unthought-of by
their former associates west of the Sierra.</p>
<p>John B. Trask, in his report on mines and mining in California,
made to the legislature of California in 1855, says: &ldquo;In my
report of last year, it was stated that the placer ranges were at
that time known to extend nearly to the summit ridge of the
mountains; but this year it has been ascertained that they pass
beyond the ridge and are now found on the eastern declivity,
having nearly the same altitude as those occurring on the opposite
side. Within the past season, many of these deposits have
been examined, and thus far are found to be equally productive
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
with those of similar ranges to the west, and, with a
favorable season ensuing, they will be largely occupied.&rdquo; It is
probable that Trask&rsquo;s statements were based on reports of the
work done by Lee Vining&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>At any rate, in 1857 it became known among the miners
of the Mother Lode that rich deposits had been found at
&ldquo;Dogtown&rdquo; and Monoville, and a rush from the Tuolumne
mines resulted. The Mono Trail from Big Oak Flat, through
Tamarack Flat, Tenaya Lake, Tuolumne Meadows, and Bloody
Canyon, following in general an old Indian route, was blazed
at this time and came into great use. The Sonora Pass route was
used also, and it was over this trail that the discoverer of the
famous Bodie district, later to become the center of all Mono
mining, made his way.</p>
<p>It is not my purpose, however, to write the history of Mono
County, or even to make this a lengthy story of Mono mining
camps. Rather would I present a concise account of the origin
of the relics found by Sierra enthusiasts, and, incidentally, tell
something about the astonishing town of Bodie.</p>
<p>The name Tioga and the beautiful region which its mention
suggests are now familiar to thousands who annually drive
over the route that bisects Yosemite National Park. The original
location of the mineral deposit now known as the Tioga
Mine was made in 1860. Consequently, it is here that our
present chronicle of Yosemite summit events should begin. In
1874, William Brusky, a prospector, came upon a prospect
hole, shovel, pick, and an obliterated notice at this place. The
notice indicated that the mine had been located as &ldquo;The Sheepherder&rdquo;
in 1860. It was presumed by Brusky that the original
locators were returning to Mariposa or Tuolumne from Mono
Diggings, Bodie, or Aurora when they made the find. He flattered
the claim by supposing that &ldquo;the original locators probably
perished, as it is not likely that they would abandon so
promising a claim&rdquo;; he relocated it as the &ldquo;Sheepherder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>In 1878, E. B. Burdick, Samuel Baker, and W. J. Bevan organized
the Tioga District. Most of the mines were owned by men
of Sonora, although some Eastern capital was interested. The
district extended from King&rsquo;s Ranch, at the foot of Bloody
Canyon, over the summit of the Sierra and down the Tuolumne
River to Lembert&rsquo;s Soda Springs. It was eight miles in extent
from north to south. At one time there were 350 locations in
the district. Bennetville (now called Tioga) was headquarters
for the Great Sierra Mining Company offices, which concern
was operating the old Sheepherder as the &ldquo;Tioga Mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company apparently suffered from no lack of funds,
and operations were launched on a grand scale. Great quantities
of supplies and equipment were packed into the camp at
enormous expenditure of labor and money. At first the place
was accessible only via the Bloody Canyon trail, and Mexican
packers contracted to keep their pack animals active on this
spectacular mountain highway. A trail was then built from
the busy camp of Lundy, and that new route to Tioga proved
most valuable. The <i>Homer Mining Index</i> of March 4, 1882,
describes the packing of heavy machinery up 4,000 feet of
mountainside to Tioga in winter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The transportation of 16,000 pounds of machinery across one
of the highest and most rugged branches of the Sierra Nevada
mountains in mid-winter, where no roads exist, over vast fields and
huge embankments of yielding snow and in the face of furious
wind-storms laden with drifting snow, and the mercury dancing
attendance on zero, is a task calculated to appall the sturdiest
mountaineer; and yet J. C. Kemp, manager of the Great Sierra
Consolidated Silver Company of Tioga, is now engaged in such an
undertaking, and with every prospect of perfect success at an early
day&mdash;so complete has been the arrangement of details and so intelligently
directed is every movement. The first ascent, from Mill Creek
to the mouth of Lake Canyon, is 990 feet, almost perpendicular.
From that point to the south end of Lake Oneida, a distance of
about two miles, is a rise of 845 feet, most of it in two hills aggregating
half a mile in distance. The machinery will probably be
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
hoisted straight up to the summit of Mount Warren ridge from the
southwest shore of Lake Oneida, an almost vertical rise of 2,160
feet. From the summit the descent will be made to Saddlebags Lake,
thence down to and along Lee Vining Creek to the gap or pass in
the dividing ridge between Lee Vining and Slate creeks, and from
that point to Tunnel, a distance of about one mile, is a rise of about
800 feet&mdash;most of it in the first quarter of a mile. The machinery
consists of an engine, boiler, air-compressor, Ingersoll drills, iron
pipe, etc., for use in driving the Great Sierra tunnel. It is being
transported on six heavy sleds admirably constructed of hardwood.
Another, or rather, a pair of bobsleds, accompanies the expedition,
the latter being laden with bedding, provisions, cooking utensils,
etc. The heaviest load is 4,200 pounds. Ten or twelve men, two mules,
4,500 feet of one-inch Manila rope, heavy double block and tackle,
and all the available trees along the route are employed in &ldquo;snaking&rdquo;
the machinery up the mountain&mdash;the whole being under the
immediate supervision of Mr. Kemp, who remains at the front and
personally directs every movement. It is expected that all the sleds
will be got up into Lake Canyon today, and then the work will
be pushed day and night, with two shifts of men. Meantime, the
tunnel is being driven day and night, with three shifts of men under
Jeff McClelland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such difficulties prompted the Great Sierra Mining Company
to construct the Tioga Road, that they might bring their
machinery in from the west side of the Sierra. The road was
completed in 1883 at a cost of $64,000.</p>
<p>In 1884, one of those &ldquo;financial disasters&rdquo; which always seem
to play a part in mining-camp history overtook the Great Sierra
Mining Company, and all work was dropped. Records show
that $300,000 was expended at Tioga, and there is no evidence
that their ore was ever milled.</p>
<p>Persons who have climbed into that interesting summit region
above Gaylor Lakes have no doubt pondered over the
origin of the picturesque village of long-deserted rock cabins
clustered about a deep mine shaft. This is the Mount Dana
Summit Mine, one of the important locations of the Tioga
District. Its owners were determined to operate in winter, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
well as in summer. In the <i>Homer Mining Index</i>, Lundy, of
October 30, 1880, we are told that the superintendent of this
mine visited Lundy and employed skilled miners to spend
the winter there. In December of the same year one of them
descended to Bodie to obtain money with which to pay those
miners. &ldquo;He got tripped up on Bodie whisky and was drunk
for weeks. Some of the miners returned to Lundy from the
Summit Mine. The distance is but seven miles, but they were
two days making the trip and suffered many hardships.&rdquo; Later
F. W. Pike took charge of the Summit Mine, but no record
appears to have been handed down of the final demise of
the camp.</p>
<p>Another camp of the main range of the Sierra that received
much notice and actually produced great wealth was Lundy,
situated but a few miles north of Tioga. Prior to 1879, W. J.
Lundy was operating a sawmill at the head of Lundy Lake. His
product helped to supply Bodie&rsquo;s enormous demand for timber.
In the spring of 1879, William D. Wasson took his family
to Mill Canyon, near Lundy Lake, and engaged in prospecting.
He was followed by C. H. Nye and L. L. Homer, who located
rich veins of ore. J. G. McClinton, of Bodie, investigated and
was persuaded by what he found to bring capital to the new
camp at once. Homer District was organized at Wasson&rsquo;s residence
at Emigrant Flat, in Mill Creek Canyon, September 15,
1879. Prior to this time the region was included in the Tioga
District, but because the books of the Tioga recorder were kept
at an inconvenient point, a new district was formed. L. L.
Homer, for whom the district was named, bowed down by
&ldquo;financial troubles,&rdquo; committed suicide in San Francisco a few
months later.</p>
<p>It is worthy of mention that in 1881 the Sierra Telegraph
Company extended its line from Lundy to Yosemite Valley,
where it made connection with Street&rsquo;s line to Sonora.</p>
<p>A trail was built from Tioga over the divide from Leevining
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
Canyon into Lake Canyon, thence down Mill Creek Canyon
to Lundy. In 1881 Archie Leonard, renowned as a Yosemite
guide and ranger, put on a ten-horse saddle train between
Lundy and Yosemite. The trip was made in a day and a half,
and the fare was $8.00 one way.</p>
<p>Reports of the State Mining Bureau indicate that something
like $3,000,000 was taken from the May Lundy Mine. The
town of Lundy proved to be substantial for many years, and
the <i>Homer Mining Index</i>, printed there, is the best of all the
newspapers that were produced in the ephemeral camps of
Mono. Something of the spirit of mining-camp journalism may
be gathered from the following note taken from a December,
1850, number of the <i>Index</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i>Index</i> wears a cadaverous aspect this week. It is the unavoidable
result of a concatenation of congruous circumstances. The
boss has gone to Bodie on special business. The devil has been
taking medicine, so that his work at the case has been spasmodic
and jerky. The printing office is open on all sides, and the snow flies
in wherever it pleases. In the morning everything is frozen solid.
Then we thaw things out, and the whole concern is deluged with
drippings. It is hard to set type under such conditions. When the
office is dry, it is too cold to work. When it is warm, the printer
needs gum boots and oilskins. In fact, it has been a hell of a job to
get this paper out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the other camps, Lundy is now defunct. The May
Lundy Mine has not operated for some years, and the building
of a dam has raised Lundy Lake so that a part of the townsite
is submerged.</p>
<p>Another old camp that many Yosemite fishermen and hikers
come upon is the aggregation of dwellings about the &ldquo;Golden
Crown.&rdquo; At the very head of Bloody Canyon, within Mono Pass,
are to be found sturdily built log cabins in various stages of
decay. From the <i>Homer Mining Index</i> it has been possible to
glean occasional bits of information regarding this old camp.
It is stated in an 1880 number of the <i>Index</i> that Fuller and
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
Hayt (or Hoyt) discovered large ledges of antimonial silver
there in 1879. The <i>Mammoth City Herald</i> of September 3,
1879, contains a glowing account of the wealth to be obtained
from the &ldquo;Golden Crown,&rdquo; as the mine was christened, and predicts
that thousands of men will be working at the head of
Bloody Canyon within one year. The <i>Mammoth City Herald</i>
of August 27, 1879, under the heading, &ldquo;Something Besides
Pleasure in Store for Yosemite Tourists,&rdquo; contains an enthusiastic
letter regarding these prospects.</p>
<p>When one observes the great number of mining claims
staked out throughout the summit region about White Mountain,
Mount Dana, Mount Gibbs, and Kuna Peak, it is not
surprising to learn that some Yosemite Valley businessmen ventured
to engage in the gamble. Albert Snow, proprietor of the
famous La Casa Nevada between Vernal and Nevada falls,
owned a mine in Parker Canyon; and A. G. Black, of Black&rsquo;s
Hotel, owned the Mary Bee Mine on Mount Dana.</p>
<p>Some twenty miles south of the Tioga District, in a high
situation quite as spectacular in scenic grandeur as any of the
camps of the main range of the Sierra, was Lake District, in
which Mammoth and Pine City flourished for a time&mdash;a very
brief time.</p>
<p>In June of 1877, J. A. Parker, B. N. Lowe, B. S. Martin, and
N. D. Smith located mineral deposits on Mineral Hill at an
altitude of 11,000 feet. Lake District was organized here that
same summer. Activity was not great until 1879, when great
riches seemed inevitable, and a rush of miners swelled the population
of Mammoth and Pine City. A mill was built for the
reduction of ores that were not in sight, and two printing establishments
cut each other&rsquo;s throats, the <i>Mammoth City Herald</i>,
first on the ground, and the <i>Mammoth City Times</i>.</p>
<p>For a time hope was high. J. S. French built a toll trail
from Fresno to Mammoth City. French&rsquo;s saddle trains met the
Yosemite stages at Fresno Flats, and traveled to Basaw (or
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
Beasore) Meadows, Little Jackass Meadows, Sheep Crossing,
Cargyle Meadow, Reds Meadow, through Mammoth Pass, and
then to Mammoth City, a distance of fifty-four miles. Livestock
to supply the Mammoth markets was driven from Fresno
Flats over this trail, also.</p>
<p>The first winter after propaganda had inveigled capital to
take a chance on Mammoth, all activities persisted through
the winter. Like those hardy men who suffered the hardships
of winter on Mount Dana, the inhabitants of Mammoth contended
with great difficulties.</p>
<p>After the winter of 1879-80, it became apparent that the
Mammoth enterprise was unwarranted. The mill, constructed
with such optimism, was poorly built. Had it been mechanically
perfect, the fate of the camp would have been no better,
for the expected ore was not forthcoming. Mammoth was
another of those camps which engulfed capital and produced
little or nothing. In the winter of 1880-81 the place closed.</p>
<p>Benton, Bodie, and Aurora are quite removed from the area
likely to be reached by Sierra travelers, yet to close this account
without some mention of their birth, growth, and death would
be to omit some of the most important affairs of Mono mining.
The first settlement in the region immediately south of
Mono was made by George W. Parker, who located the Adobe
Meadows in 1860. In 1861 E. C. Kelty sent &ldquo;Black&rdquo; Taylor, a
partner of the discoverer of Bodie District, to winter some
cattle in Hot Springs Valley, where he was killed by Indians.
William McBride entered the region in 1853 and engaged in
ranching. Float rock was found in October, 1863, by Robinson
and Stuart in the foothills of the White Mountains, east of
Benton. In February, 1864, these men organized the Montgomery
District and succeeded in attracting some attention to their
find. The region flourished for a season, but soon declined and
became deserted. A few very rich deposits existed, but there
seem to have been no continuous veins.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="ss"><span class="large">SKETCH MAP OF YOSEMITE REGION</span>
<br />SHOWING EARLY ROUTES &amp; CENTERS, &amp; WITH PRESENT-DAY PLACE NAMES INCLUDED FOR REFERENCE.</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<h3>EXPLANATION OF SKETCH MAP OF YOSEMITE REGION</h3>
<h4>DISCOVERY</h4>
<p class="revint">In 1833 the Joseph Walker party crossed the Sierra, entering the Yosemite National Park
region from the northeast and approximately following the route shown (Green Creek-Glen
Aulin-present Tioga Road route). Several members looked into Yosemite Valley on a
scouting trip from a camp along the Merced-Tuolumne divide. The party discovered the
Big Trees (Tuolumne or Merced groves).</p>
<h4>FIRST ENTRY</h4>
<p class="revint">In 1849-50 J. D. Savage maintained a trading post and mining camp below Yosemite Valley
at the confluence of the Merced and its South Fork. In the spring of 1850 this station was
attacked by Indians.</p>
<p class="revint">Savage then removed his post to a safer location on Mariposa Creek. In December, 1850,
Indians destroyed this post and murdered those in charge. Savage had established a branch
store on the Fresno River, and this station was also burned in December, 1850.</p>
<p class="revint">As a result the white settlers organized a volunteer company to punish the Indians. A camp
of 500 Indians was found on a tributary of the San Joaquin River. The savages were routed.</p>
<p class="revint">Governor McDougal then authorized organization of the Mariposa Battalion. On March 19,
1851, they set out for Yosemite (Mariposa-Wawona-Old Inspiration Point). The Battalion&rsquo;s
first Yosemite Valley camp was near Bridalveil Creek. Their second was at Indian Canyon.
They explored the valley to the vicinity of Snow Creek Falls and the foot of Nevada Fall.</p>
<p class="revint">Later in 1851 Captain Boling and party returned to Yosemite to make final disposition of the
Indians (Fort Miller-Mariposa-Wawona). After two weeks of scouting they located the
Indians at Tenaya Lake (via Indian Canyon). The entire tribe was captured and brought
to the reservation on the Fresno River. Old Chief Tenaya was later permitted to take his
family back to Yosemite. Other members of his tribe soon ran away to join him.</p>
<p class="revint">In 1852, eight prospectors entered the valley and two of them were killed by the Yosemites.
As a result regular soldiers from Fort Miller, under Lt. Moore, made a third expedition to
Yosemite. They followed the fleeing Indians to Mono Lake (Tenaya Lake-Soda Springs-Mono Pass)
but captured none of them. On Moore&rsquo;s return (Soda Springs-Little Yosemite-Glacier Point vicinity-Wawona)
to Mariposa he exhibited mineral specimens found in
the summit region and Lee Vining was induced to go to the region to prospect. In 1853,
according to Bunnell, wrathy Mono Indians, trailing stolen horses, came over the mountains
and ended all Yosemite Indian troubles by virtually exterminating Tenaya&rsquo;s band. But
Maria Lebrado, a survivor, denied this (see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>).</p>
<h4>EAST-SIDE MINING EXCITEMENT</h4>
<p class="revint">In 1857, five years after Lt. Moore&rsquo;s findings, word reached miners west of the range that rich
placers had been found at Mono Diggings (Monoville). A rush from the Tuolumne Region
followed. This excitement lasted but a few years.</p>
<p class="revint">In 1860 the Sheepherder Mine was located at Tioga. A prospect hole, shovel, pick, and obliterated
notice were found in 1874 by William Breuschi, who relocated the lode. The Tioga
District was organized October 18, 1878.</p>
<p class="revint">In 1859, Brodigan, Doyle, Garraty, and W. S. Body had located rich ground at Bodie. By 1879
there were 8,000 people in Bodie. More than $24,000,000 has been produced here.</p>
<p class="revint">In 1879 the Homer District was organized at Lundy, on ground discovered by C. H. Nye.</p>
<p class="revint">In 1882-83 a wagon road, following the old alignment of the present Tioga Road, was built
from Crockers to Bennetville (Tioga) in order that machinery might be brought up the west
slope. Road construction cost $64,000, and approximately another $300,000 was spent on
development at Tioga. The mine never produced.</p>
<h4>PRESENT-DAY CULTURE</h4>
<p class="revint">The sketch map also shows the Yosemite National Park Boundary as of 1946. The boundaries
at one time included Mount Ritter and the present Devils Postpile National Monument.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cherokee Joe&rdquo; found lead ore in a long, low granite hill,
which rises abruptly out of the valley west of the White Range,
and it was here that Benton started in 1865. James Larne built
the first house, and soon the camp became quite populous.
Like the others, it attracted a printer, and for a time the <i>Mono
Weekly Messenger</i> flaunted taunts at neighboring camps and
exploited the virtues and possibilities of Benton. Like the
others, too, the camp failed, and the printer moved, this time
to Mammoth, where he founded the short-lived <i>Mammoth
City Herald</i>.</p>
<p>When, in the late &rsquo;seventies, the turbulent town of Bodie
was attaining its reputation as a tough place, a newspaper of
Truckee, California, quoted the small daughter in a Bodie-bound
family as having offered the following prayer: &ldquo;Good-by,
God! I&rsquo;m going to Bodie.&rdquo; An editor of one of the several Bodie
papers rejoined that the little girl had been misquoted. What
she really said was, &ldquo;Good, by God! I&rsquo;m going to Bodie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to accounts printed when excitement at Bodie
was high, the discoverer of the Bodie wealth, W. S. Body, came
to California on the sloop <i>Matthew Vassar</i> in 1848. He had
lived in Poughkeepsie, New York, and there left a wife and six
children. In November, 1859, Body, Garraty, Doyle, Taylor,
and Brodigan crossed Sonora Pass to test the Mono possibilities.
On their way back to the west side of the mountains, they
dug into placer ground in a gulch on the east side of Silver Hill,
one of those now pock-marked hills just above Bodie.</p>
<p>The partners apparently remained on the ground and
equipped themselves to work their claims. In March, 1860,
Body and &ldquo;Black&rdquo; Taylor went to Monoville for supplies, and
en route were overtaken by a severe snow-storm. Body became
exhausted, and Taylor attempted to carry him but was forced
to wrap a blanket around him and leave him. Taylor returned
to their cabin, obtained food, and then wandered about all
night in a vain search for his companion. It was not until May
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
that Body&rsquo;s body was found, when it was buried on the west
side of the black ridge southwest of the present town. Taylor&rsquo;s
fate has already been mentioned.</p>
<p>Other miners came into the vicinity, and at a meeting, with
E. Green presiding, &ldquo;Body Mining District&rdquo; was organized.
Subsequent usage changed &ldquo;Body&rdquo; to &ldquo;Bodie.&rdquo; In the summer
of 1860, prospectors located lodes a few miles north of Bodie
that were destined to put the Bodie find &ldquo;in the shade&rdquo; for
some years to come. This was the Aurora discovery, upon which
the Esmeralda District, organized in 1860, centered. Aurora
forged ahead and became a wildly excited camp, but its bloody
career was little more than a drunken orgy. The rich ores which
had induced extravagance and wild speculation disappeared
when shafts had been sunk about one hundred feet, and the
&ldquo;excitement&rdquo; came to a sudden end.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that the first board of county supervisors
of the county of Mono met in Aurora, June 13, 1861. By 1864
it was discovered that the camp was some miles within the state
of Nevada; so Bridgeport was named the county seat. Just before
the move was made, a substantial courthouse had been
built in Aurora, and the old building still stands. E. A. Sherman,
first editor of the <i>Esmeralda Star</i> of Aurora, journeyed
to the Eastern States prior to 1863-64, and took with him a
fifty-pound specimen of rich Aurora ore. This chunk of rock
had been sold and resold at mining-camp auctions to swell
the Sanitary Fund, the Civil War &ldquo;Red Cross.&rdquo; Thousands of
dollars were added to the fund by this one specimen, just as
had been done through repeated sale of the celebrated Austin
(Nevada) sack of flour.</p>
<p>Mr. Sherman met Mr. Davis of the Pilgrim Society in
Plymouth, Massachusetts, and exchanged the Aurora ore for
a piece of Plymouth Rock. This fragment of Plymouth Rock
was brought back to Aurora, and when the Mono County courthouse
was built there, the Plymouth Rock fragment was placed
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
in the cornerstone. The fifty-pound chunk of Aurora ore still
may be seen in the Plymouth Society&rsquo;s venerable museum.</p>
<p>Mark Twain at one time resided in Aurora and engaged
in his humorous exaggerations. His cabin there, which even
in 1878, when Wasson wrote his <i>Bodie and Esmeralda</i>, had
become somewhat mythical, was recently located and moved
to Reno, Nevada, where it is now exhibited. At any rate, an
Aurora cabin was found which might have been occupied by
Mark Twain. One part of the original Mark Twain cabin certainly
did not reach Reno, according to the <i>Mammoth Times</i>
of December 6, 1879. Bob Howland, who had lived with Mark
Twain in Aurora, returned to their old domicile in 1879 and
took down the flagpole. He had it made into canes, which he
distributed among his friends.</p>
<p>The truly important activity in the Esmeralda region
prompted the building of the Sonora Pass wagon road. The
Mono County supervisors ordered that road bonds on the
&ldquo;Sonora and Mono road&rdquo; be issued on November 5, 1863.
The road was projected in 1864 and opened to travel in 1868.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Bodie, in the meantime, had not given up the ghost, although
only a comparatively few miners occupied the camp.
From its discovery until 1877 an average of twenty votes were
polled each year. In 1878, however, the Bodie Mining Company
made a phenomenally rich strike of gold and silver ore,
and the entire mining world was startled. Stock jumped from
fifty cents to fifty-four dollars a share. The news swept all
Western camps like wildfire, and by 1879 Bodie&rsquo;s crowd and
reputation were such that the little girl&rsquo;s prayer of &ldquo;Good-by,
God! I&rsquo;m going to Bodie&rdquo; was representative of the opinion
held by contemporaries.</p>
<p>Even W. S. Body, whose body had moldered in a rocky grave
for nearly twenty years, was not undisturbed by the activity.
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
In 1871 J. G. McClinton had discovered the forgotten Body
grave while searching for a horse. He made no move to change
the burial site, however, until some one of Bodie&rsquo;s several
newspapers launched erroneous reports of the whereabouts of
Body&rsquo;s remains. In the fall of 1879 McClinton and Joseph
Wasson exhumed the skeleton, exhibited it to Bodie&rsquo;s motley
populace, and then gave it an elaborate burial, not excluding
an eloquent address by Hon. R. D. Ferguson. Now these honored
bones occupy a grave that is quite as neglected as the sage-grown
niche in which they originally rested, but at least they
share a place with the other several hundred dead disposed of
in Bodie&rsquo;s forgotten cemetery.</p>
<p>To make Bodie&rsquo;s story short, let it suffice to say that for four
years the camp maintained the same high-pressure activity.
Men mined, milled, played, fought, and hundreds died. Some
fifty companies tunneled into Bodie Bluff and all but turned
it inside out. Probably twenty-five millions in bullion were
conveyed in Bodie stage coaches to the railroad at Carson City,
Nevada. Perhaps an amount almost as great was sunk into the
hills by the numerous companies that carried on frenzied activity
but produced no wealth. Only the Standard and the Bodie
had proved to be immensely profitable, and in 1881 the stock
market went to pieces. Bodie&rsquo;s mines, one after another, closed
down. In 1887 the Standard and the Bodie consolidated and
operated sanely and profitably for some twenty years longer.
But the camp&rsquo;s mad days of wild speculation and excessive
living were done. Gradually activities ceased, and a few years
ago the picturesque blocks of frame buildings were consumed
by flames. To meet the opportunities of 1941 some several hundred
people occupied Bodie to salvage minerals from her old
mine dumps. But there was little progress in rebuilding the
town. It is interesting to note, however, that the Bodie Miners&rsquo;
Union Hall of the &rsquo;seventies still stands. Within it Mr. and Mrs.
D. V. Cain have exhibited the relics of Bodie&rsquo;s boom days.</p>

<br /><i>THE INTERPRETERS</i></h2>
<p>The superlative qualities of the scenic features and such
outstanding biological characteristics as the forests of the
Yosemite region compelled the interest of scientists as soon
as the area received wide mention in the press. The miners&rsquo;
concern with mineral values directed the attention of mining
engineers upon the sections both east and west of Yosemite
Valley. As early as 1853 Professor John B. Trask attempted to
explain the geology of the Tuolumne-Merced watersheds.</p>
<p>The California State Geological Survey was established in
1860. Josiah Dwight Whitney, of Harvard University, was
made State Geologist. He enlisted the services of several young
men who were destined to become leaders in American geological
and topographical work. William H. Brewer, William
Ashburner, Chester Averill, Charles F. Hoffmann, William M.
Gabb, James T. Gardiner, and Clarence King were among the
members of the Whitney Survey. Over a period of ten years
they penetrated the remote and unknown canyons and climbed
the peaks of the Sierra Nevada, recording their findings and
mapping the wild terrain. They made the first contribution to
accurate and detailed knowledge of the region embraced in
the present Yosemite National Park.</p>
<p>In 1863, Whitney himself began studies in the Yosemite
region.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> He concluded that the Yosemite Valley resulted from
a sinking of a local block of the earth&rsquo;s crust. His assistant,
King, recognized evidences of a glacier&rsquo;s having passed through
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
the valley, but Whitney, although he published this fact in his
official report, later stoutly denied it. Whitney at first believed
the domes to have risen up as great bubbles of fluid granite.</p>
<p>Galen Clark, while not a trained geologist, was a careful observer
and commanded considerable respect from the public.
He believed that Yosemite Valley originated through the explosion
of close-set domes of molten rock and that water action
then cleared the gorge of debris and left it in its present form.</p>
<p>King, although he was the first to observe glacier polish and
moraines in the Yosemite Valley, did not attribute any great
part of the excavation of the valley to the glacier. He regarded
the Yosemite as a simple crack or rent in the crust of the earth.</p>
<p>John Muir, who followed these early students, maintained
that ice had accomplished nearly all the Yosemite sculpturing.</p>
<p>H. W. Turner, on the other hand, found no reason to believe
that anything other than stream action, influenced by the peculiar
rock structure, had had an important role in the origin
of the valley, although he recognized that it had been the pathway
of a glacier.</p>

George F. Becker, Willard D. Johnson,
E. C. Andrews, Douglas W. Johnson, F. L. Ransome, J. N. LeConte,
A. C. Lawson, Eliot Blackwelder, Ernst Cloos, John
P. Buwalda, M. E. Beatty, and George D. Louderback have all
studied the geology of the Yosemite Valley or the Yosemite
region and have published the results of their work. The influences
of the topography of the Sierra Nevada upon meteorological
conditions were studied and reported upon by W. A.
Glassford in the early &rsquo;nineties.</p>
<p>Prior to 1913, however, no one had made a comprehensive
study of the geology of the entire Yosemite region. Ideas regarding
the origin of the valley and related features were still hazy.
In 1913, at the instance of the Sierra Club, the U. S. Geological
Survey sent out a party of scientists to begin a systematic and
detailed investigation. These men were Fran&ccedil;ois E. Matthes
and Frank C. Calkins. The former was to study especially the
history of the development of the Yosemite Valley; the latter to
study the different types of rock. In the years that have elapsed,
Matthes has carried his investigations over the entire Yosemite
region and into the areas to north and south. Thus he has
worked out quite definitely, back to its beginning, the story of
the origin of the Yosemite and of the other valleys of the same
type in the Sierra Nevada. His conclusions, published by the
government, have stood the test of criticism by other members
of his profession.</p>
<p>An extensive bibliography of the geology of Yosemite appears
in <i>A Bibliography of National Parks and Monuments
West of the Mississippi River</i>, Vol. I, 1941, pp. 95-106. The
list of Matthes&rsquo; contributions to Yosemite literature is long.
Probably the most significant and generally useful item is <i>Geologic
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
History of the Yosemite Valley</i>. This is a thorough report
on the author&rsquo;s study and also contains a paper by Frank C.
Calkins on the granitic rocks of the Yosemite region.</p>
<p>Indians provided the motive for the first penetration of the
whites into Yosemite Valley, but the ethnology of the region
received scant attention during the first years of contacts with
the aborigines. Lafayette H. Bunnell, a member of the &ldquo;discovery&rdquo;
party of 1851, has provided satisfying accounts of the
primitive Ah-wah-nee-chees in the valley, and Galen Clark,
who was intimately acquainted with members of the original
band, recorded their history, customs, and traditions many
years after his early contacts with them. In the early &rsquo;seventies,
Stephen Powers gave to them the attention of a professional
ethnologist, and Constance F. Gordon-Cumming studied them
in the &rsquo;eighties.</p>
<p>In 1898, the Bureau of American Ethnology investigated the
Indians of the Tuolumne country, and William H. Holmes
published the findings. Samuel A. Barrett first published on
the geography and dialects of the Miwok (of which the Yosemite
Indians were a part) in 1908. Barrett&rsquo;s work with the Miwok
continued for many years, and he is credited with several
important papers. Alfred L. Kroeber, a leading authority on
California Indians, first published on the Miwok in 1907 and
since has published extensively on the Ah-wah-nee-chees and
all their neighbors. E. W. Gifford, who has been associated with
both Barrett and Kroeber in the ethnological work of the University
of California, has made important contributions to the
published history and culture of the Miwok. His first paper
on his work in the Yosemite region appeared in 1916. C. Hart
Merriam devoted careful study to the myths, folk tales, and
village sites of the Yosemite Indians early in the 1900&rsquo;s, and
his published accounts appeared in 1910 and 1917. Mrs. H. J.
Taylor, working in Yosemite Valley, obtained much important
data from one of the last members of the Yosemite band, Maria
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
Lebrado, and since 1932 has published several significant items.
In 1941, Elizabeth H. Godfrey, of the Yosemite Museum staff,
compiled a popular summary of the work done on the Yosemites
entitled, &ldquo;Yosemite Indians Yesterday and Today,&rdquo; <i>Yosemite
Nature Notes</i>, 1941. The Yosemite Museum collections of objects
and documents include valuable local Indian materials,
which provide a most interesting and convincing story of the
Ah-wah-nee-chees.</p>
<p>In the field of biology, the Yosemite forests attracted the first
attention of scientists. Botanists generally agree that in the Big
Tree, the sugar pine, the yellow pine (ponderosa and Jeffrey),
the red and white firs, and the incense cedar of the Sierra is the
finest and most remarkable group of conifers in the world. The
Big Tree (<i>Sequoia gigantea</i>), of course, is the most phenomenal
and claims first place, chronologically, in the scientific literature.
In the number of workers concerned with it and in the
quantity of their writings, the Big Tree also holds a respected
place.</p>
<p>Among the early writers who dealt with the Big Tree groves
of the present Yosemite National Park were Hutchings, Whitney,
Asa Gray, Isaac N. Bromley, J. Otis Williams, Muir,
Bunnell, and Clark. The latter was among the first to study
the Sequoia groves of the Yosemite but he did not publish
for nearly half a century after he made his first observations.
Following the early announcements of the existence of the
Tuolumne, Merced, and Mariposa groves, another group of
botanists and semiprofessional workers concentrated upon the
study of the Big Tree. Walter G. Marshall, Charles Palache,
Paul Shoup, Julius Starke, George Dollar, and W. R. Dudley
made their contributions at this time, and Muir redoubled his
initial efforts. After the turn of the century, botanists and foresters
in numbers concentrated upon the Big Tree. Their publications
are too numerous to list, but special mention must
be made of the work of Willis L. Jepson, George B. Sudworth,
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
Ellsworth Huntington, James C. Shirley, L. F. Cook, and the
continued inspired writing of Muir. The sequoia, oldest living
thing, is now and always will be a fascinating subject for scientific
and philosophical study. Until a thorough investigation
of the ecology of a grove of giant sequoias has been made and
its result published, there remains a practical need for research
in this realm.</p>
<p>Botanical studies other than investigations of the Big Tree
were limited in the pioneer days to the work of John Muir.
In the early 1900&rsquo;s, Harvey M. and Carlotta C. Hall did important
work in the present national park, and their published
Works continue to be dependable guides for present-day botanists.
Enid Michael, long a resident in Yosemite Valley, was
untiring in her field studies, and her many published articles
about the flora of the park are of importance to all investigators.
Carl W. Sharsmith has studied intensively in the high
mountain &ldquo;gardens&rdquo; of the park. Mary C. Tresidder published
a very useful guide to the trees of the park in 1932. Emil F.
Ernst has studied the forests and forest enemies in the park
for many years. Willis L. Jepson&rsquo;s work constitutes a substantial
basis for all botanical studies in Yosemite as it is for other
parts of the State, and the investigations of LeRoy Abrams,
1911, have been important to subsequent workers. The studies
of George M. Wright, during his residence in the park in the
1920&rsquo;s, resulted in significant papers on life zones in Yosemite
and were the groundwork for the later important studies by
him and his associates in founding and conducting broad biological
surveys in the entire national park system&mdash;an undertaking
briefly described later in this chapter.</p>
<p>The Yosemite fauna elicited no particular attention from
pioneers other than James Capen Adams, who in 1854 captured
grizzly bears for exhibit purposes, and John Muir, who
applied himself to certain bird and mammal studies quite as
enthusiastically as he did to botany and geology. In the opening
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
years of the twentieth century, a few bird students, among
them W. Otto Emerson, W. K. Fisher, Virginia Garland, C. A.
Keeler, M. S. Ray, and O. Widman, published on their observations
in the present park, but not until Joseph Grinnell
initiated his publication program in 1911 did Yosemite zo&ouml;logy
find reasonable representation in scientific journals. Grinnell
and his staff from the Museum of Vertebrate Zo&ouml;logy of the
University of California began formal field work in Yosemite
in the fall of 1914 and continued through 1920 in making a
complete survey of the vertebrate natural history of the region.
Grinnell, Tracy I. Storer, Walter P. Taylor, Joseph Dixon,
Charles L. Camp, Gordon F. Ferris, Charles D. Holliger, and
Donald D. McLean participated in the work. The results of
this survey, Grinnell and Storer&rsquo;s <i>Animal Life in the Yosemite</i>,
published by the University of California Press in 1924, constitutes
an exhaustive and most useful reference on the subject.
David Starr Jordan considered it the best original work
on life histories published in the West. This study, like the
geological work by Matthes, was endorsed and facilitated by
the Sierra Club.</p>
<p>After the Museum of Vertebrate Zo&ouml;logy paved the way,
wildlife studies in the park increased, and Yosemite found
better representation in the biological literature. Most of
the workers who had participated in Grinnell&rsquo;s survey published
extensively. Others who made notable contributions are
Charles W. and Enid Michael, Barton W. Evermann, A. B.
Howell, Vernon Bailey, J. M. Miller, John A. Comstock, E. O.
Essig, and Edwin C. Van Dyke.</p>
<p>After 1920, when the National Park Service instituted a
park-naturalist program in Yosemite, the regular and seasonal
employees of the Naturalist Department made many contributions
to the scientific knowledge of the park. Among the
permanent park naturalists who conducted biological investigations
are Ansel F. Hall, Carl P. Russell, George M. Wright,
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
C. A. Harwell, C. C. Presnall, A. E. Borell, M. E. Beatty, James
Cole, C. Frank Brockman, M. V. Walker, Harry Parker, and
Russell Grater. D. D. McLean, who participated in the Grinnell
Survey, also made further contributions as a regular employee
of the Naturalist Department. Dr. H. C. Bryant, first
as a seasonal employee and later as a regular member of the
Director&rsquo;s staff, published extensively on his studies in the park
and was influential in starting many other workers on investigations
of biological nature.</p>
<p>One important development in biological research in Yosemite
had an influence on the wildlife program of the entire
National Park Service. George M. Wright, ranger and Assistant
Park Naturalist, during the late 1920&rsquo;s sensed the dangers
of the unco&ouml;rdinated wildlife policy of the National Park Service
and determined that there should be better administrative
understanding of the normal biotic complex of Yosemite and
all other national parks. In 1929, Wright was placed on a field
status in order that he might organize a central unit of wildlife
investigators to survey the wildlife problems of the National
Park Service and recommend a broad Service-wide policy of
wildlife management. Joseph S. Dixon and Ben W. Thompson
were employed by Wright to assist him in this undertaking.
Their work during the next several years was conducted from
headquarters in Berkeley, California, and from Washington,
D. C. It demonstrated that a Wildlife Division was an important
administrative adjunct in the Director&rsquo;s organization. In
1936, Wright lost his life while in the course of his significant
work. Such progress had been made in establishing policy and
procedure that the program persisted. It holds a strategic place
in the regular administrative set-up of the Director&rsquo;s office and
reaches all field areas with its guidance.</p>
<p>The bibliography of scientific work done in Yosemite National
Park since World War I is too extensive to be included
here. A goodly part of it is contained in <i>A Bibliography of
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
National Parks and Monuments West of the Mississippi River</i>.
References to research projects published since the appearance
of that bibliography appear in the publications of the Yosemite
Natural History Association, particularly the monthly journal,
<i>Yosemite Nature Notes</i>. Especially significant items dealing
with wildlife policy and trends in park management are included
in the references appended to the present volume. In
brief, it may be said that the wildlife problems of Yosemite
National Park are now fairly well defined and that administrative
and technical practices are so aligned as to assure preservation
of the faunal and floral characteristics of the reservation
within the concept of &ldquo;public enjoyment and use&rdquo; of today and
tomorrow. As Director of the National Park Service, Newton
B. Drury has said, &ldquo;It is national park policy to display wildlife
in a natural manner. The normal habits of animals are interfered
with as little as possible, and artificial management is
refrained from except for protective purposes and then only
as a last resort. The pauperizing or domestication of the native
animals is avoided, as is also the herding or feeding of these
animals to provide &lsquo;shows.&rsquo; Under this policy the park is a wildlife
refuge but it is neither a circus or a zoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wildlife of Yosemite, like its forests and wildflower displays,
its renowned cliffs and waterfalls, its glacial pavements,
its meadows and valleys, and its spectacular mountaintops, has
enthralled its lay visitors quite as it has galvanized the scientist
and technician. When Stephen T. Mather assumed the directorship
of the national parks in 1916, he determined at the
outset to provide park visitors with the information on the
natural and historic features which they wanted. Educational
endeavors were made a part of his projected program even
before a staff had been organized. Surveys of outdoor educational
methods and nature teaching as practiced in several
European countries had been made in 1915 by C. M. Goethe,
and his reports of the success of this work had inspired a few
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
Americans to establish similar educational work in the United
States. The California Fish and Game Commission in 1918
sent its educational director, Dr. Harold C. Bryant, into the
Sierra to reach vacationists with the message of the conservationist.
Yosemite National Park and the playground areas
about Lake Tahoe witnessed the introduction of &ldquo;nature guiding&rdquo;
several years prior to the inclusion of the work in the
broad field program of the National Park Service.</p>
<p>In 1920, Mr. Mather and some of his friends joined in supporting
this nature teaching in Yosemite, and Dr. Bryant and
Dr. Loye Holmes Miller were employed to lay the foundation
of what has continued to be an important part of the program
of the Branch of Natural History.</p>
<p>A personal letter from Dr. Miller, University of California,
Los Angeles, provides a firsthand account of his pioneering in
interpretive work in Yosemite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think John Muir was the first Yosemite guide (see <i>A Son of the
Wilderness</i>, by L. M. Wolfe). We smaller folk could only strive to
emulate. My first experience in the valley involved a six-week
period during the summer of 1917 under private auspices. Professor
M. L. Maclellan (geology) and I (biology) held a summer school for
public school teachers who were largely from Long Beach, California.
The work consisted of lectures and field trips about the valley
floor and the trails to the rim and to Merced Lake.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1919 I was doing similar work at Tahoe
when Mr. Stephen T. Mather came through on a flying trip. He
asked me to confer with him on the subject of Nature Guide work
in Yosemite and urged me to come at once to the valley and begin
the work there. It was late in the season and I had spent most of
my free time for the year. Furthermore, it seemed to me that
there should be some preparation made for the work, including
a measure of publicity in the park guidebooks. I therefore urged
Mr. Mather to wait until 1920 for the inauguration of an official
Nature Guide service. He agreed and we parted with a definite plan
for 1920.</p>
<p>In the meantime Mr. C. M. Goethe of Sacramento had become
interested in the movement and had engaged Dr. H. C. Bryant
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
in a tour of certain summer camps. I also urged the appointment
of Dr. Bryant for the Yosemite work in 1920. My University schedule
was such that Dr. Bryant was able to report earlier than I. He
therefore gave the first official work in the valley. We co&ouml;perated
in it after my arrival. I knew that I could not devote many summers
to the service because of other duties as an officer of the University.
Furthermore, it seemed to me that Dr. Bryant was just the man to
carry on to a larger field of development. I therefore urged repeatedly
that he make a full-time activity of the movement. This end
was ultimately realized. Bryant made all the official reports of our
work (with my endorsement). Those reports are in the files of the
Superintendent&rsquo;s office in the park.</p>
<p>During the month of January, 1921, Dr. Bryant and I gave our
services to the cause in an extended lecture tour through the eastern
and middle western states. This effort was underwritten personally
by Mr. Mather. The purpose and theme in this series was
to publicize and stimulate interest in the natural history values
of the park and the appreciation of nature through an increased
knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>I returned to Yosemite in the summer of 1921&mdash;again in co&ouml;peration
with Dr. Bryant. The movement seemed to be well on its feet
so I withdrew at the end of that summer. We were appointed as
temporary rangers with duties informally defined. Each morning
a field trip was conducted by one or the other of us alternately, the
alternate holding office hours for questions by visitors. (Questions
averaged 45 to the hour). In the afternoon a children&rsquo;s field class
was held. In the evening we alternated with talks at Camp Curry
and the &ldquo;Old Village&rdquo; near Sentinel Bridge. They were busy days
but interest was good. Week ends were devoted to overnight trips
by one or the other of us.</p>
<p>At the urgent request of Mr. Ansel Hall I initiated the same type
of work at Crater Lake Park, Oregon, in 1926 and continued it in
1927. My son, Alden Miller, was associated with me and two students,
Miss Leigh Marian Larson and Miss Ruth Randall, acted as
volunteers in charge of wildflower display. Reports of this work
should be in the Crater Lake files. During the summer we were visited
by Mr. Mather, by Dr. John C. Merriam, and by Mr. John D.
Rockefeller and family. The interest of these men was immediate
and finally bore material fruit in improvement of Crater Lake Park
and the whole Nature Guide movement in America. Just as had
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
been the case at Yosemite, we were appointed as rangers. My duties
at Crater Lake included nature guiding, directing traffic, comforting
crying babies, rounding up stray dogs, and a wild drive down
the mountain to Medford Hospital with a writhing appendicitis
patient and his distracted wife in the rear seat.</p>
<p>I have not been officially connected with the work since but have
sent many graduate students to the Yosemite Field School with
what I hope was the right point of view. My own retirement at 70
years leaves me out of the picture except in an advisory capacity.
Just last week in conference with my associates here, I urged Park
Naturalist activity as one of the public services for which our department
should train young men. So you see that my interests are
still with the movement. It is a field of infinite horizon.
<span class="center">Sincerely yours,</span>
<span class="lr"><span class="sc">Loye Miller</span></span></p>
<p>March 18, 1946.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. H. C. Bryant, the coworker referred to by Dr. Miller, became
Assistant Director of the National Park Service in charge
of interpretive work for all national parks. To Dr. Miller&rsquo;s statement
may be added Bryant&rsquo;s words about interpretive work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the spring of 1921, through a co&ouml;perative arrangement with
the California Fish and Game Commission, the National Park
Service instituted a free nature-guide service in Yosemite. The aim
of this service was to furnish useful information regarding trees,
wildflowers, birds, and mammals, and their conservation, and to
stimulate interest in the scientific interpretation of natural phenomena.
The means used to attain this aim were: trips afield; formal
lectures, illustrated with lantern slides or motion pictures;
ten-minute campfire talks, given alternately at the main resorts of
the park; a stated office hour when questions regarding the natural
history of the park could be answered; a library of dependable
reference works, and a flower show where the commoner wildflowers,
properly labeled, were displayed. Occasionally, visiting
scientists helped by giving lectures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About this same time, a Yosemite ranger, Ansel F. Hall, conceived
the idea of establishing a Yosemite museum to serve as
a public contact center and general headquarters for the interpretive
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
program. Superintendent W. B. Lewis endorsed the
plan, and the old Chris Jorgenson artists&rsquo; studio was made into
a temporary museum; Hall was placed in charge as permanent
educational officer. The same year found a museum program
under way in Yellowstone National Park, where Milton P.
Skinner was made park naturalist, and in Mesa Verde National
Park, where Superintendent Jesse Nusbaum organized a museum
to care for the archeological treasures brought to light
among the ruins of prehistoric man&rsquo;s abode. Glacier, Grand
Canyon, Mount Rainier, Rocky Mountain, Sequoia, and Zion
quickly organized educational programs similar to those established
by Yosemite and Yellowstone, and in 1923 Hall, with
headquarters in Berkeley, was designated to co&ouml;rdinate and
direct the interpretive work in all parks. Working with Dr.
Frank R. Oastler, Hall in 1924 organized a comprehensive
plan of educational activities and defined the objectives of the
naturalist group.</p>
<p>In 1924, C. J. Hamlin was president of the American Association
of Museums. The opportunities opened by national
park museums were called to his attention by Hall, and the
American Association of Museums immediately investigated
the possibilities of launching adequate museum programs in
the parks. In response to recommendations made by the Association
and the National Park Service, the Laura Spelman
Rockefeller Memorial made funds available with which to
construct a fireproof museum in Yosemite National Park. This,
one of the first permanent national park museums, became the
natural center around which revolves the educational program
in Yosemite. Even before the Yosemite museum installations
had been opened to the public, demonstration of the effectiveness
of the institution as headquarters for the educational
staff and visiting scientists convinced leaders in the American
Association of Museums that further effort should be made
to establish a general program of museum work in national
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
parks. Additional funds were obtained from the Laura Spelman
Rockefeller Memorial, and new museums were built in
Grand Canyon and Yellowstone national parks. Dr. Herman
C. Bumpus, who had guided the museum planning and construction
in Yosemite, continued as the administrator representing
the association and Rockefeller interests, and Herbert
Maier was architect and field superintendent on the construction
projects. It was Dr. Bumpus who originated the &ldquo;focal-point
museum&rdquo; idea.</p>
<p>When the museums of Yosemite, Grand Canyon, and Yellowstone
had demonstrated their value to visitors and staff alike,
they were accepted somewhat as models for future work, and
upon the strength of their success, the Service found it possible
to obtain regular government appropriations with which to
build several additional museums in national parks and monuments.
When P.W.A. funds became available, further impetus
was given to the museum program, and a Museum Division of
the Service was established in 1935, embracing historic areas
of the East as well as the scenic national parks. It was my privilege
to serve as the first head of this unit. The work of the
Museum Division has expanded until there are more than one
hundred small national park and monument museums and
historic-house museums; more are planned for the future.</p>
<p>In order to stimulate balanced development of interpretive
programs, Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of the Interior, appointed
a committee of educators under the chairmanship of
Dr. John C. Merriam to study the broad educational possibilities
in national parks (see Wilbur, 1929). In 1929, this
committee recommended that an educational branch, with
headquarters in Washington, be established in the Service. It
was further recommended that the committee continue to
function on a permanent basis as an advisory body, &ldquo;whose
duty it shall be to advise the Director of National Parks on
matters pertinent to educational policy and developments.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Dr. Bryant, who since 1920 had served as a summer employee
on the Yosemite educational staff and who had been a member
of the Committee on Study of Educational Problems in National
Parks, was made head of the new branch on July 1, 1930.
Antedating the establishment of the branch by one year was
the previously mentioned wildlife survey instituted in national
parks by George M. Wright, who began his career in the National
Park Service as a park ranger in Yosemite in 1927.</p>
<p>Thus it is evident that the pioneer interpretive work done
in Yosemite projected its influence and its personnel into
the wider fields of &ldquo;nature guiding&rdquo; and museum programs
throughout the National Park Service. It may be shown, also,
that the educational work done by the Yosemite staff has been
instrumental in advancing the naturalist programs in state
parks and elsewhere where out-of-door nature teaching is offered
to the public.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> Some three hundred public areas and
agencies in the United States provide naturalist services modeled
on the Yosemite plan. Only ten per cent of these are in the
National Park System.</p>
<p>One of the far-reaching influences of the Yosemite naturalist
department is the Yosemite School of Field Natural History,
a summer school for the training of naturalists, where emphasis
is placed on the study of living things in their natural environment.
The school was founded in 1925 by Dr. H. C. Bryant
in answer to a demand for better trained naturalists for the
Yosemite staff. There was need for a training not furnished by
the universities. The California Fish and Game Commission
co&ouml;perated with the National Park Service in starting this
school program. The staff is composed of park naturalists and
the regular Yosemite ranger-naturalist force, aided by specialists
from universities and other government bureaus. The last
week of the field period is spent in making studies at timberline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>As the name implies, emphasis is placed on field work. The
work is of university grade, although no university credit is
offered. Graduates of this school are filling positions as nature
guides in parks and summer camps throughout the country.
Many of the naturalist and ranger-naturalist positions in the
National Park Service are held by graduates of this field school.</p>
<p>The Park Naturalist position in Yosemite National Park
has been held by Ansel F. Hall, 1922-1923; Carl P. Russell,
1923-1929; C. A. Harwell, 1929-1940; C. Frank Brockman,
1941-1946; and now, Donald Edward McHenry. These men
and their assistants have supervised the naturalist activities
including the Yosemite Museum program, directed the Yosemite
School of Field Natural History, and the activities of the
Yosemite Natural History Association, including the editing
and publishing of <i>Yosemite Nature Notes</i>. This last-named organization
has existed since 1924 as a society co&ouml;perating with
the National Park Service in advancing the work of the Yosemite
Naturalist Department. It is the successor of the Yosemite
Museum Association formed by Ansel F. Hall in 1920. On
April 24, 1925, members of its advisory council and board of
trustees defined these purposes of the Association:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. To gather and disseminate information regarding birds, mammals,
flowers, trees, Indians, history, geology, trails, scenic features,
and other subjects so well exemplified by Nature in Yosemite National
Park and elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>2. To develop and enlarge the Yosemite Museum (in co&ouml;peration
with the National Park Service) and to establish subsidiary units,
such as the Glacier Point Lookout and branches of similar nature.</p>
<p>3. To contribute in every way possible to the development of the
educational activities of the Yosemite Nature Guide Service.</p>
<p>4. To publish (in co&ouml;peration with the National Park Service)
<i>Yosemite Nature Notes</i>, a periodical containing articles of scientific
interest concerning the matters referred to in this statement
of purposes.</p>
<p>5. To promote scientific investigation along the lines of greatest
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
popular interest and to publish from time to time bulletins or circulars
of a nontechnical nature.</p>
<p>6. To maintain in Yosemite Valley a library containing works of
historical, scientific, and popular interest.</p>
<p>7. To study the living conditions, past and present, of the remaining
Indians of the Yosemite region, for the purpose of preserving
their arts, customs, and legends.</p>
<p>8. To strictly limit the operations, business, property, and assets
of the association to purposes which shall be scientific and educational,
in order that the association shall not be organized, constituted,
or operated for profit, and so that no part of the net income
of the association shall inure to the benefit of any member or other
party thereto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These objectives in almost every particular are also the objectives
of the Naturalist Department of Yosemite National
Park. In 1937 the Congress authorized park naturalists and
other government employees to devote their regular working
hours to the program of the Yosemite Natural History Association
and similar &ldquo;co&ouml;perating societies&rdquo; in national parks
which might be designated by the Secretary of the Interior.
In effect, the Yosemite Natural History Association is an auxiliary
of the naturalist department. For nearly twenty-five
years it has adhered to its defined purposes, and the support
it has given to the interpretive program has furthered research
in the park, enriched the collections of the Yosemite Museum,
and promoted the dissemination of the Yosemite story.</p>
<p>The function of the interpreters has been, and their purpose
must be, to enrich the mountain experience of the Yosemite
traveler and thereby demonstrate that a national park is far
more than a tourist&rsquo;s way station. Upon today&rsquo;s visitor and
his full awareness of national-park values the future of the
national-park concept must depend. A public which, in its
enjoyment of the parks, comprehends the importance of &ldquo;the
scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife
therein&rdquo; will insist that they remain unimpaired.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><i>GUARDIANS OF THE SCENE</i></h2>
<p>In the body of Indian fighters who first entered Yosemite
Valley, there appears to have been but one man who sensed
the possibilities of public good to be derived from the amazing
place just discovered. A year prior to the entry of the
Mariposa Battalion, L. H. Bunnell, in climbing the trail from
Ridley&rsquo;s Ferry (Bagby) to Bear Valley, had descried in the eastern
mountains an immense cliff which, apparently, loomed,
column-like, to the very summit of the range. He looked
upon the &ldquo;awe-inspiring sight with wonder and admiration,
and turned from it with reluctance to resume the search for
coveted gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, on March 25, 1851, Bunnell stood at Inspiration
Point with other members of Savage&rsquo;s command and gazed
upon the extravagance of natural wonders, he recognized &ldquo;the
immensity of rock&rdquo; which had, the previous year, astonished
him from afar. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haze hung over the valley&mdash;light as gossamer&mdash;and clouds partially
dimmed the higher cliffs and mountains. This obscurity of
vision but increased the awe with which I beheld it, and as I looked,
a peculiar exalted sensation seemed to fill my whole being, and I
found my eyes in tears with emotion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He withdrew from the trail and stationed himself on a projecting rock,
where he might contemplate all that was spread
before him. Major Savage, bringing up the rear of the column,
brought him out of his soliloquy in time to join the battalion
in its descent to the floor of the valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>The party that night discussed the business of naming the
valley as they sat about their first campfire, near the foot of
Bridalveil Fall. Bunnell comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It may appear sentimental, but the coarse jokes of the careless,
and the indifference of the practical, sensibly jarred my more devout
feelings, while this subject was a matter of general conversation;
as if a sacred subject had been ruthlessly profaned, or the
visible power of Deity disregarded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bunnell&rsquo;s later discussions with residents of the Mariposa
hills and his very tangible evidence in the form of personal
funds expended on the Coulterville trail to Yosemite, indicate
that he was the first to strive for public recognition of the
assets available in the new scenic wonderland. Other men of
the region were understandably slow to develop aesthetic appreciation
for that which only thrilled and produced no gold.</p>
<p>By 1855 rumor and conjecture regarding the mysteries of the
valley had created sufficient interest among the old residents
and the many newcomers in the mining camps to prompt fascination
in J. M. Hutchings and his story when he returned to
Mariposa after his first &ldquo;scenic banqueting&rdquo; under Yosemite
walls. With the publication of the Hutchings articles and the
Ayres drawings, curiosity may be said to have become general,
and the trek to the valley was started.</p>
<p>The entire mountain region was, of course, public domain,
and, though it had not been surveyed, it was generally conceded
that pre&euml;mption claims could be made upon it. Homesteaders
were establishing themselves in numerous mountain
valleys above the gold region, and such &ldquo;squatting&rdquo; was done
with the assent of state and federal officers. It is hardly surprising
that some local aspirants laid claim to parts of Yosemite
Valley. The company that expected to develop a water project
in 1855 was apparently the first to attempt to establish rights.
Then came the series of would-be hotel owners, whose activities
have been described. James C. Lamon was a mountaineer
who came to Yosemite in 1859 and aided in the building of
the Cedar Cottage. While so engaged, he established himself in
the upper end of Yosemite Valley and there developed the first
bona fide homestead by settlement. For many years his log cabin
was a picturesque landmark in the valley, and today two orchards
near Camp Curry serve as reminders of his pioneering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>With the advent of the &rsquo;sixties California began to recognize
the aesthetic value of some of her mountain features. The
acclaim of leaders from the East and the expressed wonder of
notables from abroad played a part in the development of a
state pride in the beauties of Yosemite, and, gradually, it became
apparent that only poor statesmanship would allow private
claims to affect an area of such world-wide interest.</p>
<p>On March 28, 1864, Senator John Conness,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> of California,
introduced in the U. S. Senate a bill to grant to the State of
California tracts of land embracing the Yosemite Valley and
the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees. On May 17, his bill was reported
out of committee. On the occasion of the debate which
followed, Senator Conness entered into the record of American
conservation the first evidences of national consciousness of
park values as we conceive of them today. He started the long
train of legislative acts which have given the United States the
world&rsquo;s greatest and most successful system of national parks.
It is a fact, of course, that the Senate action of 1864 did not
create a national park but it did give Federal recognition to
the importance of natural reservations in our cultural scheme,
and charged California with the responsibility of preserving
and presenting the natural wonders of the Yosemite.</p>

<p>Senator Conness explained to the Senate that it was the purpose
of his bill &ldquo;to commit them [Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa
Grove of Big Trees] to the care of the authorities of that
State for their constant preservation, that they may be exposed
to public view, and that they may be used and preserved for the
benefit of mankind.... The plan [of preservation] comes from
gentlemen of fortune, of taste, and of refinement.... The bill
was prepared by the commissioner of the General Land Office,
who also takes a great interest in the preservation both of the
Yosemite Valley and the Big Trees Grove.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The bill was passed by the Senate on May 17, referred to the
House Committee on Public Lands on June 2, debated and
passed by the House on June 29, and signed by President Lincoln
on July 1, 1864. These deliberations, which designated
the first scenic reservation for free public use, were consummated
under the stress of waging war.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate friction and delays in the operation of
legislative machinery, proponents of the Yosemite bill secured
its passage without recognition of the private claims made
by Yosemite settlers. Lamon, clearly a bona fide homesteader;
Hutchings, who had a short time before the passage of the
act purchased the Upper Hotel property; Black, the owner of
Black&rsquo;s Hotel; and Ira Folsom, interested in the Leidig property,
pressed their claims and involved the new state park in
prolonged litigation.</p>
<p>The State Park Act provided that the Yosemite Grant and
the Mariposa Big Trees should be managed by a board of
commissioners, of whom the governor of the state was to be
one. On September 28, 1864, three months after the grant was
made, Governor F. K. Low proclaimed that trespassing upon
the tracts involved must desist. His board of Yosemite commissioners
was appointed in the same proclamation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Frederick Law Olmsted, even then an accomplished landscape
architect, was made chairman of the board. As Brockman
(1946, p. 106) has revealed in his article on Olmsted, the chairman
was also the first administrative officer of the Yosemite
Grant. Olmsted&rsquo;s statement of 1890 substantiates this fact: &ldquo;I
had the honor to be made chairman of the first Yosemite Commission,
and in that capacity to take possession of the Valley
for the State, to organize and direct the survey of it and to
be the executive of various measures taken to guard the elements
of its scenery from fires, trespassers and abuse. In the
performance of these duties I visited the Valley frequently,
established a permanent camp in it and virtually acted as its
Superintendent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Legal acceptance of the gift could not be made until the next
session of the state legislature. On April 2, 1866, the necessary
provisions for administration were secured. The board of commissioners
made the best possible selection of a guardian, the
Yosemite pioneer, Galen Clark, and invited the settlers of the
valley to vacate their holdings.</p>
<p>J. M. Hutchings, as might be expected, was wrathy. It is
probable that James Lamon, after eight years of permanent
residence on his land, saw no justice in the act. The other
claimants held out for what might be in it. Hutchings and
Lamon refused to surrender their property, and a test suit was
brought against Hutchings, which was decided in his favor.
This was carried to the supreme court of the state and then to
the federal Supreme Court. In these last actions the commissioners
were sustained. That Hutchings and Lamon were deserving
of consideration and remuneration cannot be denied,
but millions of Americans are today indebted to the board of
commissioners who pursued the case to a settlement favorable
to the people. Private titles of the type held by the Yosemite
Valley settlers would have been disastrous to all administration
in the years that were to come.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Hutchings and Lamon were deserving
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
of certain sympathy. No man had done more than J. M. Hutchings
to call attention to the fact that the Yosemite was a wonderland,
eminently worthy of the distinction bestowed upon
it by the state. For a decade prior to the creation of the state
park, he had devoted himself to disseminating knowledge on
its &ldquo;charming realities.&rdquo; Much of this was done through his
<i>California Magazine</i> and the lithographic reproductions of the
Ayres drawings. Some of it was accomplished with his volume,
<i>Scenes of Wonder</i>, which ran through several editions. The
many published testimonials of his worth as guide and informant
while operating his Hutchings House in Yosemite Valley
indicate that his efforts to engender a public love for the place
were not spared even after his difficulties arose with the state.
And, finally, during the ten-year fight for reimbursement he
lectured throughout the country, bringing home to the dwellers
in Eastern cities the fact that a phenomenally beautiful
area in California was worthy of their visit. Some of the manuscripts
of these Eastern lectures are possessed by the Yosemite
Museum. Their text reveals none of the commercialism and
selfishness with which Hutchings sometimes has been charged.</p>
<p>The earnest efforts which Hutchings had expended in interesting
the public in Yosemite had not failed to create an
interest in him as well. The court had refused further consideration
of the claims of the settlers, but the state legislature,
influenced by public feeling and the expressed approval of
the Yosemite commissioners, appropriated $60,000 to compensate
the four claimants. Of this Hutchings received $24,000;
Lamon, $12,000; Black, $13,000; Folsom, $6,000, and the remaining
$5,000 was returned to the State Treasury. Because of
this prolonged litigation, the commissioners did not secure full
control of the grant until 1875.</p>
<p>To what extent such troubles would dissipate the best directed
efforts of a board of managers of any business can well
be imagined. Further difficulties developed when road privileges
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
were granted. The state legislature failed to sustain the
position of the commissioners in the matter of exclusive rights
for a road on the north side of the valley, and again a controversy
arose which directed heated criticism upon the management
of the state park. Public hostility alternated with general
indifference. The state failed to provide adequate funds with
which to accomplish the important work before the commissioners,
and the lack of a well-defined policy handicapped the
administration to a point of ruin. In 1880 a new law removed
the first board and appointed a new one.</p>
<p>The next decade saw important developments take place
in the park, but policies adopted were sure to displease someone
or some faction. Criticism still prevailed. Gradually the
seethings of the press brought about the development of intelligent
public interest in Yosemite affairs. Indifference was
replaced by discriminating attention, and Yosemite administration
arrived in a new era.</p>
<p>In these pages not enough has been said about John Muir.
His contributions to the preservation of Yosemite National
Park, to the determination of scientific facts regarding it, and
to public understanding of its offerings place him in the front
rank of conservationists who have been instrumental in saving
representative parts of the American heritage. The role he
played as explorer, researcher, interpreter, and defender of
the public interests in the Yosemite may well become the subject
of another book of Muiriana; however, at this juncture, it
is only possible to relate him rather inequitably to the field of
Yosemite administrative history.</p>
<p>John Muir arrived in Yosemite for the first time in 1868.
Intent upon making deliberate studies of all that fascinated
him, he determined to remain a resident of the Yosemite region.
In order to do so, he attached himself to a sheep ranch.
He gave the first winter to work on the foothill ranch and the
next summer to herding in the Yosemite Sierra. With the intimate
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
acquaintance so made with sheep and their ways, he was
destined to create a wave of public interest in Yosemite that
would eclipse all former attentions and revolutionize the administrative
scheme.</p>
<p>For eight years after his first Sierra experience, John Muir
rambled over his &ldquo;Range of Light.&rdquo; He tarried for some time
in Yosemite Valley and was employed by J. M. Hutchings, at
times, to operate a sawmill, which Muir immortalized merely
by inhabiting it.</p>
<p>Some impression of his first employment in Yosemite Valley
and his early outlook upon the Yosemite scene may be gained
from these paragraphs of his memoirs published by Bad&egrave;.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the good fortune to obtain employment from Mr.
Hutchings in building a sawmill to cut lumber for cottages,
that he wished to build in the spring, from the fallen pines
which had been blown down in a violent wind-storm a year
or two before my arrival. Thus I secured employment for two
years, during all of which time I watched the varying aspect
of the glorious Valley, arrayed in its winter robes; the descent
from the heights of the booming, out-bounding avalanches
like magnificent waterfalls; the coming and going of the noble
storms; the varying songs of the falls; the growth of frost crystals
on the rocks and leaves and snow; the sunshine sifting through
them in rainbow colors; climbing every Sunday to the top of
the walls for views of the mountains in glorious array along the
summit of the range, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I boarded with Mr. Hutchings&rsquo; family, but occupied a
cabin that I built for myself near the Hutchings&rsquo; winter home.
This cabin, I think, was the handsomest building in the Valley,
and the most useful and convenient for a mountaineer. From
the Yosemite Creek, near where it first gathers its beaten waters
at the foot of the fall, I dug a small ditch and brought a stream
into the cabin, entering at one end and flowing out the other
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
with just current enough to allow it to sing and warble in low,
sweet tones, delightful at night while I lay in bed. The floor
was made of rough slabs, nicely joined and embedded in the
ground. In the spring the common pteris ferns pushed up between
the joints of the slabs, two of which, growing slender like
climbing ferns on account of the subdued light, I trained on
threads up the sides and over my window in front of my writing
desk in an ornamental arch. Dainty little tree frogs occasionally
climbed the ferns and made fine music in the night, and
common frogs came in with the stream and helped to sing with
the Hylas and the warbling, tinkling water. My bed was suspended
from the rafters and lined with libocedrus plumes,
altogether forming a delightful home in the glorious Valley at
a cost of only three or four dollars, and I was loath to leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was not running Hutchings&rsquo; mill, he was making
lonely trips of discovery or guiding visitors above the valley
walls. Perhaps Muir knew of the use he would make of the
natural history data he was gathering, but few of his associates
sensed the fact that he would soon make the nation quicken
with new views of Yosemite values.</p>
<p>He first made his influence felt in the early &rsquo;seventies, when
he began publishing on Yosemite in journals and periodicals.
His material awakened responses everywhere. On February 5,
1876, he published an article in the <i>Sacramento Record Union</i>
which was one of the initial steps in his forceful appeal to
America to save the Yosemite high country from the devastations
of sheep and the incendiary fires of sheepherders.</p>
<p>It is likely that few who today enjoy the Yosemite High
Sierra realize that sheep, &ldquo;hoofed locusts,&rdquo; were responsible for
the creation of Yosemite National Park. The people of California,
awakened to the danger by the warnings of Muir and
others, attempted to secure an enlargement of the state park.
Selfish local interests frustrated the plan. In 1889, John Muir
allied himself with the <i>Century Magazine</i>, and a plan was
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
launched which was designed to arouse a public sentiment that
could not be shunted. Muir produced the magic writings, and
Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of the <i>Century</i>, secured
the support of influential men in the East. On October 1, 1890,
a law was enacted which set aside an area, larger than the present
park, as &ldquo;reserved forest lands.&rdquo; Within this reserve were
the state-controlled Yosemite and Mariposa Grove grants.</p>
<p>The reactions of residents of the regions adjacent to the
new national park to this legislation was typical of the period.
Citizens of the counties affected could not foresee the coming
of unbroken streams of automobile traffic, which eventually
would bring millions of dollars to their small marts of trade.
The thought of losing some thousands of acres of taxable land
caused county seats to seethe with unrest. The local press
painted pictures of dejected prospects and near ruin. The following
summary of a lengthy wail from a contemporary paper
reveals the fears that prevailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us summarize the result of our analysis. On the one side, we
have 932,600 acres of land taken away from the control and use
of the people at large, and of the people of Mariposa, Tuolumne,
Mono, and Fresno counties in particular, for the ostensible purpose
of preserving timber, mineral deposits, and natural curiosities or
wonders within said reservation&mdash;for whose benefit, the act does not
say, but presumably for the benefit of tourists.</p>
<p>On the other side, we find: That the avowed object of preserving
forests appears to be only a false pretense to cover up the real object
of the scheme, whatever it may be&mdash;that to preserve mineral deposits
will prevent untold treasures from being employed in industry
and commerce, and prevent the employment of thousands for
many years to come in the exploration of these mineral deposits&mdash;that
to preserve natural curiosities and wonders, it is not necessary
to fling away nearly a million acres of land, when all that is necessary
can be accomplished by attaching to each wonder as much
land, as, through natural formation, contributes in any measure
towards its maintenance&mdash;that, if on the one hand, these claims are
respected, it will condemn hundreds of American settlers to poverty,
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
if, on the other hand, these claims are bought out, it will entail
an expense of many millions on the country, whilst the claimants,
themselves, will never receive anything like the amount their properties
would be worth, in the course of time, if this part of the
country is left to its own development without Government interference,
and all the settlements now existing will be left to fall
into decay and ruin, or will have to be worked by a system of tenantry,
a curse, as contemporary history shows, which ought never
be allowed to take root in our country.</p>
<p>The preservation of the full watershed of the Yosemite Valley is
not only a legitimate, but a desirable object; the same holds good
with the Hetch-Hetchy Valley, or any other grand work of nature.
Every alienation of land, beyond this, is of evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This local feeling resulted in immediate attempts to change
the park boundaries. The first attempt was frustrated largely
through the efforts of the Sierra Club. This organization came
into existence shortly after Yosemite National Park was created
and has always been one of the most important agencies that
have promoted the safety of Yosemite treasures. Its publication,
the <i>Sierra Club Bulletin</i>, which first appeared in 1893, is a rich
source of Yosemite history. For twenty-two years John Muir
was the president of the club. His vim in leaping to the defense
of the great natural preserve was no less than had been his vigor
in working for its creation. Muir aided in the preservation of
national monuments as well. In early May, 1903, Theodore
Roosevelt, then president, visited Yosemite via Raymond and
the Mariposa Grove. Governor George C. Pardee, Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, president of the University of California, and
John Muir were among those who interpreted the scene for
the President. Conservation matters were discussed by Muir
and the legislation which was to become famous as the Antiquities
Act of 1906 was given some definition at this time. It was
truly an important occasion.</p>
<p>Chief among the Sierra Club defenders of Yosemite who
have carried on since the death of Muir is William E. Colby.
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
He served forty-four years as secretary of the organization, two
years as president, and is now, as a director, a frequently sought
source of counsel. He led the club&rsquo;s summer outings for more
than three decades. Throughout this period Colby has unceasingly
built the Sierra Club&rsquo;s prestige in the field of conservation.
For the past six years he has served as a member of the
Yosemite Advisory Board, and has been in close touch with
past and current park problems.</p>
<p>The failure of the national government to provide funds
with which to extinguish private claims within the park involved
the administration in difficulties which are being felt
even yet. By 1904 relations between administrative officers and
the large number of owners of private holdings had become
so strained that legal action was imperative. Boundary revisions
were required. Major Hiram M. Chittenden headed the commission
appointed to investigate possible boundary changes.
Upon the recommendation of this commission large areas on
the east and west were lopped off. In 1906 a tract on the southwest
was cut off, and since that time small changes have been
rather numerous. Private lands still exist within the park and
constitute an ever-present source of trouble.</p>
<p>From the first the control of Yosemite National Park has
been vested in the Secretary of the Interior. Immediately after
the passage of the act of creation, military units were detailed
to take charge of all national park lands. The state retained its
plan of administration of the original Yosemite Grant, and so
came about the dual control which for sixteen years colored
the Yosemite administration with petty misunderstandings and
hindered progress in the maintenance of the entire region.</p>
<p>Galen Clark&rsquo;s old ranch (Wawona) became headquarters for
the Acting Superintendent of the federal preserve. From this
eccentric hub, patrols of cavalrymen were sent into the unbounded
wilderness area of the new preserve. A trail system
and accurate maps did not exist. One of the first undertakings
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
of the early superintendents was to make the rough country
accessible by horse trail. The topography was studied, and a
good map was prepared. Following the practice established in
Yellowstone National Park, patrolling stations were established,
and the United States Army had the safety of Yosemite&rsquo;s
fauna and flora fairly within its keeping.</p>
<p>Since pioneer days, sheep and cattlemen had enjoyed unrestricted
use of the excellent range which was now forbidden
them. Naturally they were reluctant to abandon it. Their trespass
was the most formidable threat with which the troopers
were confronted, and concerted, ingenious work was necessary
to expel the intruders. When the first culprits were taken into
custody, it was found that no law provided for their punishment.
Congress had failed to provide a penalty for the infraction
of park rules. Nothing daunted, the superintendents put
the captured herders under arrest and escorted them across the
most mountainous regions to a far boundary of the park. There
they were liberated. The herder&rsquo;s sheep were driven out of the
reserve at another distant point. By the time the herder had located
his animals, his losses usually were so great as to represent
a more severe punishment than could have been meted out by
the court had the law applied. Several years of this practice
caused neighboring ranchers to keep their animals out of the
forbidden territory.</p>
<p>Captain Abram Epperson Wood was the first superintendent.
With detachments from the Fourth Cavalry he arrived in
the park on May 19, 1891, and continued in charge until his
death in 1894. Each year the troopers came in April or May and
withdrew in the fall. During the winter two civilian rangers
attempted to patrol the area. With such inadequate winter protection,
it is small wonder that poachers grew to feel that the
wild life of the reserve was their legitimate prey. It was not
until 1896, in fact, that a determined effort was made to keep
firearms out of the park at any time of the year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>For twenty-three years the Department of the Interior continued
to call upon the War Department for assistance in administering
Yosemite National Park. Eighteen army officers
took their turn at the helm. Some of them assumed leadership
after some years of Yosemite experience as subordinate officers.
Others were placed in command with no previous service in
the park. Lieutenant (later Colonel) Harry C. Benson and
Major W. W. Forsyth were perhaps the most distinguished of
the superintendents. Benson was certainly more than a superintendent;
he was an explorer, map maker, trail builder, fish
planter, and nemesis of the sheepmen. Among the subordinate
officers and enlisted men a number left their mark by way of
accomplishments. N. F. McClure and Milton F. Davis are remembered
for their explorations and excellent map making.
William F. Breeze and W. R. Smedberg worked with McClure
and Benson in stocking the headwaters of the Yosemite rivers
with trout. A. Arndt pioneered in exploration of some of the
northern sections of the park. Many others in the military
organizations are remembered in place names throughout the
Yosemite High Sierra.</p>
<p>Yosemite was fortunate in having within its National Park
Service personnel one man, Gabriel Sovulewski,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> who pioneered
with these army units and who was acting superintendent
of the park in 1908-1909 and again in 1914. For thirty-five
years Mr. Sovulewski was actively engaged in caring for Yosemite.
An unpublished manuscript on his National Park Service
experiences is preserved in the Yosemite Museum. Within it
he comments upon the Yosemite work of United States troops.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>National Parks in California, and Yosemite especially, owe much
to the late Colonel H. C. Benson. No one who has not participated
in those strenuous years of hard riding and incessant fighting of
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
natural and human obstacles can ever realize the need for indomitable
spirit and unselfish devotion to a cause that existed during
those first years in Yosemite National Park. Sheep and cattle overran
the country. They were owned by men who knew every foot of
the terrain. We were ordered to eliminate them. There were few
or no trails, and maps did not exist. Reliable guides were unobtainable,
and we had more than a thousand square miles to cover.</p>
<p>Officers with detachments set out upon patrols that would keep
them away from our base of supplies for thirty days at a time. Many
times rations were short, and sixteen to twenty hours of action per
day, covering sixty miles in the saddle was not unusual. Constant
hammering at the offending cattlemen continued for several years,
and at last they were convinced that they must vacate the territory
set aside for National Park purposes. The would-be poachers and
the entire countryside were taught a moral lesson which still has its
effect today. Some of the present-day administrative problems are
made easier because of the foundation laid in those first years of
the park&rsquo;s existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The duplication of effort and expense which resulted from
the anomaly of state and federal administration within the
reserve brought about controversies which finally caused many
Californians to conclude that their Yosemite State Grant of
1864 might well be placed in the hands of the federal government,
to be managed by the same officers who controlled the
surrounding national park. The Sierra Club and many civic
organizations took the lead in urging recession. Not a few citizens
felt that the proposed move was an affront to state pride.
This group proved to be an obstacle but was overcome in 1905,
when the state legislature re-ceded to the United States the
Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove. A formal
acceptance by Congress brought the Yosemite State Park to an
end on August 1, 1906. Major Benson removed military headquarters
from Camp A. E. Wood (Wawona), and Fort Yosemite
came into existence on the site of the present Yosemite Lodge.</p>
<p>For seven years the administrative organization set up by the
military continued to function. The succeeding superintendents
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
found their responsibilities increased considerably. Other
national parks were coming into existence, and a national conscience
was beginning to recognize the value of wilderness preserves.
In 1910 the American Civic Association had launched
a campaign for the creation of a national park bureau. President
Taft favored central administration of the parks, and bills
were introduced creating such a bureau. Major William T.
Littebrant was in command in Yosemite when Dr. Adolph C.
Miller, a civilian, became assistant to Secretary Lane and was
placed in charge of the national parks. The next year troops
did not come to Yosemite. Mark Daniels was made superintendent,
and civilian employees undertook the work that had been
done by the troopers.</p>
<p>A few civilian rangers had assumed the care of the park each
winter when troops were withdrawn. Archie O. Leonard had
been the first of these and he remained in the service when
the administrative change was made. In 1914 &ldquo;park rangers&rdquo;
came into existence under authorization of Secretary Lane.
They patrolled the park as had the troopers, but, unlike the
troopers, they remained in touch with their problems throughout
the year.</p>
<p>In 1916 Congress created the National Park Service. Dr.
Miller, in the meantime, had been called to other work, and
Stephen T. Mather, who had followed Dr. Miller as assistant
to the secretary, was made Director of the National Park Service.
He was authorized by law to &ldquo;promote and regulate the
federal areas known as the national parks, monuments, and
reservations.&rdquo; Conservation of scenery and wildlife of the areas
was declared by Congress to be a fundamental purpose of the
new organization. Mr. Mather&rsquo;s first undertaking was to balk
exploitation schemes. Unfortunately, Yosemite had already
been raided. In 1913 Congressman John E. Raker had introduced
a bill granting to San Francisco rights to the Hetch
Hetchy as a water reservoir. Secretary Garfield had opened the
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
way to this move in 1908. In spite of much opposition, the
Raker Bill was passed by the House and Senate and approved
by President Wilson. Since that time the Hetch Hetchy dam
has become a reality and provides all the administrative difficulties
and troubles that were expected.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Private holdings in Yosemite were rather large even after the
boundary changes of 1905 and 1906 were made. Timber companies
possessing tracts of choice forest constituted the greatest
menace. Some of these private lands have been bought up, and
others have been exchanged.</p>
<p>During 1930 much progress was made in the acquisition
of private holdings in the national park. There were 15,570
acres of land involved, which cost approximately $3,300,000.
Half of the cost of purchasing these lands was defrayed by John
D. Rockefeller, Jr., the remainder coming from the fund provided
by Congress for the acquisition of private holdings in
national parks.</p>
<p>The following statements regarding timber holdings in and
near Yosemite National Park are taken from the Report of the
Director of National Park Service for 1930:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is impossible to overestimate the importance of this Yosemite
forest acquisition. It brought into perpetual Government ownership
the finest remaining stands of sugar-pine timber in the area
and reduced the total area of private holdings in that park to 5,034
acres. This total will be materially reduced when two pending deals
are consummated. A tract containing 640 acres is now in course
of acquisition with funds contributed by George A. Ball, of Muncie,
Indiana, as is another of about 380 acres, half the funds for
the latter transaction being contributed through the co-operation
of Dr. Don Tresidder, president of the Yosemite Park and Curry
Company.</p>
<p>Additional timber holdings in the Tuolumne River watershed&mdash;fine
stands of sugar and yellow pine&mdash;remain in private ownership
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
outside the park. One cannot help regretting that they are imperiled,
and it is hoped by all friends of these majestic forests that they
may yet be saved.</p>
<p>In order that the beauty of the Big Oak Flat Road may be unimpaired,
arrangements have been made between the Sugar Pine
Lumber Co., the Forest Service, the State, and the Park Service to
preserve the roadsides through selective cutting of the larger trees
and careful removal of any trees that are taken out. Particularly
interesting and valuable stands of timber which should be preserved
untouched will be made the subject of exchanges between
the Forest Service and the Sugar Pine Lumber Co.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This land acquisition program was finally assured of success
in July, 1937, when legislation authorized the Secretary of
the Interior to acquire the Carl Inn Tract, comprising some
7,200 acres of magnificent sugar pine forest bordering the western
boundary of the park. After a year and a half of negotiations
with the Yosemite Sugar Pine Lumber Company, owner
of most of the tract, agreement was reached on a price of
$1,495,500 to be paid by the United States. The purchase was
consummated early in 1939. Senator William Gibbs McAdoo
and Representative John S. McGroarty, both of California,
were the ardent supporters who introduced the bills, S. 1791
and H.R. 5394, in their respective houses.</p>
<p>Policies regarding the toll roads by which tourists could
enter the park constituted another perplexing problem with
which the young National Park Service was confronted. The
routes had been privately constructed and were privately
owned and controlled by turnpike companies. Government
funds were not available with which to purchase them outright.
One company was persuaded to turn the Wawona Road
over the public in exchange for a grant for the exclusive
rights to the route during a certain number of years. The government
assumed responsibility for the maintenance of the
road during this period. The owners of the Coulterville Road
could not be persuaded to agree to such a plan. As a result,
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
that part of it which is within the park has not been maintained
and, because of erosion, has fallen into disuse.</p>
<p>The Tioga Road had been constructed in 1882-1883 by the
Great Sierra Consolidated Silver Mining Company for the purpose
of serving the Tioga Mine. The mining venture terminated
in 1884 after an expenditure of $300,000 had been made.
The road had become impassable during the many years of
neglect, but it was still the property of private owners when
the region through which it passes became a national park.
Stephen T. Mather and some of his friends bought it privately
and in 1915 turned it over to the federal government. The state
of California purchased the portions of the route which were
outside of the park and extended the road eastward, down Leevining
Canyon, so giving Yosemite a remarkable high mountain
highway, free from toll, which connects Yosemite Valley
with the routes of the Mono basin. Tolls were also removed
from the Big Oak Flat route. Every effort was made to put all
recognized routes in the best of condition consistent with government
appropriations. Travel to the park grew apace, and
Yosemite had, indeed, entered a new era.</p>
<p>The first scheme of centralized administration of the national
park system was promising in theory but proved faulty
in practice. More than a few difficulties appeared on the parks
horizon. The national preserves were regarded in Washington
somewhat as orphans and were not receiving the specialized
attention so necessary for their proper administration. The
introduction of Mather ideals and methods was required to
bring about co&ouml;rdination.</p>
<p>The story is told that one day in 1915 Stephen Mather
walked into the office of Secretary Lane and expressed indignation
over the way things were run in Sequoia and Yosemite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; said Lane, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t like the way those parks are
run, you can run them yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Secretary, I accept the job,&rdquo; was Mather&rsquo;s rejoinder.</p>

<p>The genial Secretary of the Interior showed him into a little
office and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your desk, Steve; now go to work.&rdquo;
With that Lane went out and closed the door, but presently
opened it and said, &ldquo;By the way, Steve, I forgot to ask what your
politics are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such brief preliminaries did Stephen T. Mather assume
directorship of the national parks. He served through the presidential
administrations of Wilson, Harding, and Coolidge, but
the matter of his politics was never inquired into by any party.</p>
<p>Stephen Mather was born on the Fourth of July, 1867, in San
Francisco. His ancestry traces back to Richard Mather, a Massachusetts
clergyman of the days of the Pilgrim Fathers. Stephen
T. Mather was not a scion of wealth. As a young man, he made
his way through college by selling books. He graduated from
the University of California in 1887 and for several years was
a newspaper reporter. Thereafter, he entered the employ of
the Pacific Coast Borax Company and was identified with the
trade name, &ldquo;Twenty-Mule Team Borax,&rdquo; that became well
known around the world. For ten years he engaged in the production
of profits for his employers and then organized his own
company. It was in borax that he built up his business success
and accumulated the fortune which &ldquo;he later shared so generously
with the nation through his investments in scenic beauty
on which the people receive the dividends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For more than twenty-five years Stephen Mather resided in
Chicago, Illinois, but his loyalty to his native state, California,
never waned. He was the leading spirit in the organization of
the California Society of Illinois and, as its secretary, always
secured donations of a carload of choice California fruits to be
served at the Society&rsquo;s annual banquets. Mather then saw to it
that these affairs were well written up by the press and telegraphed
throughout the country on the Associated Press wires.
In this publicity the spirit and motives of the present Californians,
Inc., had their birth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>As might well be expected, Mather was a member of the
Sierra Club and participated in many of its summer outings.
(See Farquhar, 1925, pp. 52-53.) He became acquainted with
national park areas on these trips, and it is said that his ideal
of a unified administration of the parks resulted from the intimacies
so acquired. It was his ambition to weld the parks
into a great system and to make them easily accessible to rich
and poor alike.</p>
<p>At the time Mather undertook his big task, there were thirteen
parks. Some of them were difficult of access and provided
few or no facilities for the accommodation of visitors. Government
red tape stood in the way of action in the business of
park development, but Mather cut the red tape. When government
appropriations could not meet the situation, he usually
produced &ldquo;appropriations of his own.&rdquo; It was such generosity
on his part which gave the Tioga Road to the government
and saved large groves of Big Trees in the Sequoia National
Park. In his own office it was necessary for him personally to
employ assistants. Because of the lack of government funds,
he expended twice his own salary in securing the personnel
needed to set his parks machine in operation. The national
benefits derived from the early Mather activity in the parks
were recognized by Congress, and that body took new cognizance
of national park matters. Larger appropriations were
made available, and Mather&rsquo;s plans were put into effect.</p>
<p>For fourteen years he gave of his initiative and strength, as
well as his money. His ideas took material form, and the park
system came into being as he had planned. His work was recognized
and appreciated. In 1921 George Washington University
bestowed upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Law.
His alma mater, the University of California, conferred the
same degree in 1924. President W. W. Campbell on that occasion
characterized him as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stephen Tyng Mather, mountaineer and statesman; lover
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
of Nature and his fellow-men; with generous and farseeing
wisdom he has made accessible for a multitude of Americans
their great heritage of snow-capped mountains, of glaciers and
streams and falls, of stately forests and quiet meadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1926 he was awarded the gold medal of the National
Institute of Social Sciences for his service to the nation in
national parks development. The American Scenic and Historical
Preservation Society awarded the Pugsley gold medal
in recognition of his national and state park work, and he was
made an honorary member of the American Society of Landscape
Architects.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>In the fall of 1928, Mather&rsquo;s health failed. He suffered a
stroke of paralysis which forced his retirement from public
service in January, 1929. For more than a year he fought to regain
his strength but in January, 1930, he was suddenly stricken
and died quickly. Indeed, &ldquo;the world is much the poorer for his
passing, as it is much the richer for his having lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Mather&rsquo;s first acts as Director of the National Park
Service was to appoint a strong man to the superintendency
of Yosemite National Park. On the staff of the Geological Survey
was an engineer of distinction, Washington B. (&ldquo;Dusty&rdquo;)
Lewis. Mather appointed him to the Yosemite task and he
became the first park superintendent on March 3, 1916. The
Yosemite problems were complicated and trying from the beginning.
The park was, even then, attracting more visitors than
had been provided for. Public demands kept steadily ahead of
facilities that could be made available through government
appropriations. For more than twelve years W. B. Lewis expended
his energy and ingenuity in bringing the great park
through its formative stages.</p>
<p>Under his superintendency practically all the innovations
which today characterize the public service of a national park
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
were instituted in Yosemite. Motor buses replaced horse-drawn
stages; tolls were eliminated on all approach roads; the operating
companies were reorganized and adequate tourist accommodations
were provided at Glacier Point and Yosemite
Valley; a modern school was provided for local children; the
housing for park employees was improved; the best of electrical
service was made available; the park road and trail system
was enlarged greatly and improved upon; the construction of
an all-year highway up the canyon of the Merced made the
park accessible to a degree hardly dreamed of; provision of all-year
park facilities met the demands of winter visitors; a new
administrative center was developed; the Yosemite High Sierra
Camps were opened; and an information service was devised.
The ranger force was so organized as to make for public respect
of national park ideals and personnel. The interpretive work,
which makes for understanding of park phenomena and appreciation
of park policies, was initiated in Yosemite and has taken
a place of importance in the organization of the entire national
park system.</p>
<p>In short, the present-day Yosemite came into existence under
the hands of Lewis and his assistants. How well the demands
of the period were met and future requirements provided for
is evidenced by the continued healthy growth and present success
of the Yosemite administrative scheme.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1927 Lewis was stricken by a heart attack. He
later returned to his office, but in September, 1928, it became
apparent that he should no longer subject himself to the strain
of work at the high altitude of Yosemite Valley. He removed
to West Virginia, and there partly regained his strength. Director
Mather then sought his services as Assistant Director of the
National Parks, and in that capacity he functioned until the
summer of 1930. His physical strength, however, failed to keep
pace with his ambitious spirit, and after another attack, he
died at his home in a Washington suburb on August 28, 1930.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Soon after Lewis accepted his Washington appointment,
Director Mather experienced the breakdown which brought
about his resignation as Director. There was but one man to
be thought of in connection with filling the difficult position.
That man was Horace M. Albright, who had been Mather&rsquo;s
right-hand man since the National Park Service had existed.
A native of Inyo County, California, and a graduate of the University
of California, he became an assistant attorney in the
Department of the Interior, Washington, D. C., in order to
advance his learning, and there took a keen interest in plans
then developing for the establishment of the National Park
Service. He was detailed to work in connection with park problems
and had already become familiar with them when Stephen
T. Mather assumed their directorship. The Secretary of the
Interior assigned him to Mather as a legal aid, which position
quickly grew in responsibilities as the two men became
acquainted. From the first, Albright was the Director&rsquo;s chief
reliance, and when the National Park Service was organized in
1916, he was made Assistant Director. In 1917, 1918, and 1919
he aided in the creation of Mount McKinley, Grand Canyon,
Acadia,<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> and Zion national parks. At twenty-nine, he was made
superintendent of the largest of all parks, Yellowstone, and
in addition shouldered the job of Field Director of the Park
Service. In that capacity he compiled budgets, presented them
to congress, and handled general administrative problems in
the West.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Outstanding among his special interests in park problems
was his vigorous participation in programs launched to conserve
and re&euml;stablish the native fauna of national parks. He
gained an intimate understanding of the needs of American
wild life and actively engaged in attempts to supply its wants.
He allied himself with such organizations as the National Geographic
Society, the American Game Protective Association,
the American Forestry Association, the American Bison Society,
the American Society of Mammalogists, the Boone and
Crockett Club, the Save-the-Redwoods League, and the Sierra
Club. He became an expressive factor in American conservation
and in his own domain, the national parks, practiced what
he preached. He recognized the importance of ecological study
of the great wilderness areas, with the safety of which he was
charged, and pressed into service a special investigator to work
on Yellowstone mammal problems. Later he seized upon the
opportunity to extend this research to all parks. In keeping
with his desire to assemble scientific data for the preservation
of fauna and flora, he had an ambition to popularize the natural
sciences as exemplified in the varied park wonderlands. He
engaged actively in the development of plans for the museum,
lecture, and guide service which today distinguishes the national
parks as educational centers as well as pleasure grounds.</p>
<p>Upon the resignation of Director Mather in 1929, it was but
natural that Albright should succeed him. He entered into the
Yosemite administrative scheme by actual residence in the
park and study of its problems. From the Yosemite personnel
he drew new executives for other parks, field officers for the
service at large, and administrative assistants for his Washington
office. He turned to Crater Lake National Park to obtain
a superintendent who would succeed Lewis. Colonel C. G.
Thomson had distinguished himself as the chief executive
of Crater Lake and in 1929 was called to Yosemite.</p>
<p>Some of the developments in Yosemite for which Thomson
was largely responsible included the construction and improvements
of the Wawona Road and Tunnel, improvement of the
Glacier Point Road, commencement of the Big Oak Flat Road
and Tioga Road realignment, the installation of improved
water systems at the Mariposa Big Trees, Wawona, and Tuolumne
Meadows, construction of the new Government Utility
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
Building, and many smaller projects. Such important land
acquisition programs as the Wawona Basin project and the
Carl Inn sugar pine addition constituted heavy administrative
responsibilities imposed upon the superintendent&rsquo;s office during
his regime. The establishment of &ldquo;emergency programs,&rdquo;
C.C.C., C.W.A., W.P.A., and P.W.A., greatly expanded the developmental
activities in the park after 1933, and the inclusion
of the Devils Postpile National Monument and Joshua Tree
National Monument in the Yosemite administrative scheme
increased the duties of the superintendent.</p>
<p>In 1937, Colonel Thomson was stricken by a heart ailment
and died in the Lewis Memorial Hospital on March 23. In
eulogy, Frank A. Kittredge said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Thomson has, through his dynamic personality
and energy and the wealth of his experience, been an influence
and inspiration not only to the thousands of Park visitors with
whom he has had personal contact, but especially to the Park
Service itself. His keen sense of the fitness and desire for the
harmony of things in the national parks has made itself felt in
the design of every road, every structure, and every physical
development in the Park. He recognized the importance and
practicability of restricting and harmonizing necessary roads
and structures into a natural blending of the surroundings. He
has set a standard of beauty and symmetry in construction
which has been carried beyond the limits of Yosemite into the
entire National Park system. The harmony of the necessary
man-made developments and the unspoiled beauty of the Yosemite
Valley attest to the Colonel&rsquo;s injection of his refinement
of thought and forceful personality, into even the everlasting
granite itself of the Yosemite he loved so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In June, 1937, Lawrence Campbell Merriam, a native Californian,
was transferred to the superintendency of Yosemite
National Park. He had received a degree in forestry from the
University of California in 1921, had become a forest engineer,
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
and had later gone into emergency conservation work in the
state parks throughout the United States. Upon the death of
Thomson, Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes appointed
Merriam Senior Conservationist in the National Park Service
and designated him Acting Superintendent of Yosemite.</p>
<p>During his four years as the chief executive of the park he
renewed the service&rsquo;s efforts to restore the natural appearance
of the valley, and modified the master plan to provide suitable
areas for the operators&rsquo; utilities.</p>
<p>In August, 1941, Merriam became Regional Director of Region
Two, National Park Service, with headquarters at Omaha,
Nebraska. Frank A. Kittredge succeeded him in Yosemite.</p>
<p>During World War I, Kittredge served as an officer in the
Army Corps of Engineers and saw service in France. Afterward,
while with the Bureau of Public Roads, he was identified
with park work; he made the location survey of the Going-to-the-Sun
Highway in Glacier National Park, did the first road
engineering in Hawaii National Park, and devoted his attention
to national park road matters handled by the Bureau.</p>
<p>In 1927, Kittredge was appointed chief engineer of the
National Park Service and continued in that capacity for ten
years, when he was made Regional Director, Region Four, a
position involving supervision over Park Service programs in
Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah;
Glacier National Park in Montana; and the territories of
Alaska and Hawaii. In August, 1940, he was made Superintendent
of Grand Canyon National Park, from which position he
was transferred in 1941 to the chief executive position in Yosemite
National Park. In all this varied experience with the
scenic masterpieces of the national park system, Frank Kittredge
maintained a sincerity of purpose in safeguarding the
natural and historic values of the parks.</p>
<p>As was true of Mather and Albright, succeeding directors
of the National Park Service have taken personal interest and
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
active part in the management of Yosemite National Park. On
July 17, 1933, Arno B. Cammerer, formerly Associate Director,
succeeded Albright in the Washington post. During his incumbency,
1933-1940, the national park system increased from 128
areas to 204 units, and in addition to regular appropriations,
nearly 200 million dollars was expended by the Service in
connection with the programs of the Civilian Conservation
Corps, the Public Works Administration, and the Emergency
Relief Appropriation acts. Under Cammerer&rsquo;s directorship,
five C.C.C. camps were established in Yosemite National Park.
With the help of C.C.C., C.W.A., and P.W.A., many management
and construction projects in the park were advanced far
ahead of regular schedule. The Wawona Road tunnel project
was completed, and notable progress was made in constructing
the Tioga and Big Oak Flat roads on modern standards. Winter
use of the park increased mightily, and the Yosemite Park
and Curry Company developed the Badger Pass ski center in
accordance with Service plans.</p>
<p>Because of failing health, Cammerer resigned as Director in
1940, and Newton B. Drury, a Californian and a member of
the Yosemite Advisory Board, was appointed to the position
on June 19, 1940. Since 1919, Drury had been a leader in
the movement to preserve distinctive areas for park purposes.
As executive head of the Save-the-Redwoods League, he had
become a nationally recognized authority on park and conservation
affairs and was intimately acquainted with the problems
of Yosemite National Park through personal study. The
normal problems of the park and of the Service, generally, were
greatly complicated by the circumstances resulting from World
War II, and the years 1942-1945 were probably the most critical
in the history of national parks. But in spite of pressure
exerted by production interests and those who sought to capitalize
on the park&rsquo;s assets under the guise of &ldquo;war necessity,&rdquo;
the natural values of Yosemite were held inviolate. And it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
to the everlasting credit of Director Drury and his staff and
associates in central offices and the field that during the years
of all-out warfare serious inroads were nowhere made upon
national park values.</p>
<p>Each year, more than a half million people benefit by the
great park&rsquo;s offerings, and each year witnesses new demands for
expansion of public utilities provided by the operators and the
Government. To meet these demands and at the same time
guarantee &ldquo;benefit and enjoyment&rdquo; of Yosemite values for
future generations of visitors is one of the most exacting tasks
engaged in by public servants anywhere.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Two Hundred Years</span></h3>
<p>One hundred fourteen years have elapsed since the explorers in
Joseph Walker&rsquo;s party first made their way to some point on the
north rim of Yosemite Valley and beheld a tremendous scene
beneath them. It is to be hoped that the Yosemite visitor today
will have his enjoyment of Yosemite National Park somehow
enhanced by the recorded story of the human events during the
past century, particularly by the story of the human effort that
made Yosemite accessible to him, but not too accessible.</p>
<p>Yosemite, like other national parks, has its master plan.
Upon it is set down in rather definite form the conception of
the park staff of needs for physical improvements. This prescription
is reviewed by technicians and executives in central
offices and made to delimit the maximum development necessary
to meet the requirements of staff and public. The master
plan also contains an analysis of the inspirational and recreational
experiences which attract the multitude of visitors to the
park. As might be expected this analysis of Yosemite&rsquo;s offerings
points to the fact that one of the notable values of the reservation
is found in its capacity to stimulate pride in and understanding
of the heritage of natural beauty preserved within the
park&rsquo;s boundaries. Another important value is indicated in
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
the capacity of the park to serve as a repository of scientific
treasures. In this last-named role as &ldquo;museum of the out-of-doors,&rdquo;
Yosemite National Park reasonably may be expected to
become increasingly important as the less protected areas of
the Sierra Nevada are more and more encroached upon by
exploiters. The exploiters are not always concerned with livestock,
minerals, or timber. The aggressiveness of those who
cater to recreation seekers&mdash;even of the recreation seekers themselves&mdash;constitutes
a force to be reckoned with, and this group
particularly lays siege to the structure of National Park Service
conservatism.</p>
<p>It is well that the visitor to this and other national parks extend
his ken. We know something of what has happened since
1833. But what will have happened to the Yosemite region by
the year 2033 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, two hundred years after white man&rsquo;s first
glimpse of the valley? Will the men of great enterprise have
built &ldquo;ladders touching the sky, changing the face of the universe
and the very color of the stars?&rdquo; Or will there still be
a remnant of mountain sanctuary, where the handiwork of
today&rsquo;s and tomorrow&rsquo;s visitors will be as hard to discern as
Joe Walker&rsquo;s footsteps are to trace?</p>

<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>The first legislature of the state appointed a committee to report on the
derivation and definition of the names of the several counties of California. The
report is dated April 16, 1850, and from it is quoted the following:</div>
<div class="fncont">&ldquo;In the month of June, 1806 (in one of their yearly excursions to the valley of
the rushes&mdash;Valle de los Tulares&mdash;with a view to hunt elks), a party of Californians
pitched their tents on a stream at the foot of the Sierra Nevada, and whilst there,
myriads of butterflies, of the most gorgeous and variegated colors, clustered on
the surrounding trees, attracted their attention, from which circumstance they
gave the stream the appellation of Mariposa. Hence Mariposa River, from which
the county (also heavily laden with the precious metal) derives its poetical name.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>Foremost among the references is L. H. Bunnell&rsquo;s <i>Discovery of the Yosemite</i>,
published in 1880. Bunnell was closely associated with Savage during three of
his most active years in the Mariposa region; his account is intimate and rich
in detail and unprejudiced. We catch an interesting glimpse of Savage, the &rsquo;forty-niner,
through the pages also of George H. Tinkham&rsquo;s <i>California Men and
Events</i>. Something additional of his gold mining and trading is gleaned from
the writings of W. E. Wilde and S. P. Elias. Elliott&rsquo;s <i>History of Fresno County</i>
contributes a number of authenticated incidents, and J. M. Hutchings reveals
matters regarding influences that undoubtedly figured in his tragic death. United
States Senate documents record his official dealings with the Indians; L. A.
Winchell gives some information on his enemies; contemporary newspapers describe
his meeting with death; and finally <i>Depositions from the Papers of Geo.
W. Wright, One of Two First Congressmen from California</i>, provides papers
pertaining to the Court of Claims, 1858, in which appears sworn testimony
regarding the shooting of Savage. This last paper formed a part of the Boutwell
Dunlap Collection.

in 1869 and made his first trip to Yosemite in 1870. Of that experience, he wrote,
&ldquo;This trip was almost an era in my life.&rdquo; For the rest of his life, he devoted much
time to Sierra studies. He died suddenly in the valley, July 6, 1901. The LeConte
Memorial Lodge in Yosemite Valley, built by the Sierra Club in 1903, commemorates
his work (see <i>Sierra Club Bulletin</i>, 1904, 1905; Farquhar, 1926, pp. 30-32).

program of the U. S. Geographical Surveys West of the 100th Meridian, Capt.
George M. Wheeler in charge. This program received the general direction of
the Chief of Engineers, U. S. Army. Macomb's field work yielded the data for
a map which was standard in the Yosemite region for many years (see U. S. War
Dept., 1879).

Mount Conness was occupied on that occasion and again in 1887 and 1890 (see
<a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a>; also Davidson, 1892).

of Clarence King. In 1882 and 1883, a thorough study was made of the
Yosemite high country west of Mono Lake. Israel C. Russell was in charge of
this field work. Willard D. Johnson and Grove Karl Gilbert assisted him. These
men confirmed some of the original work done by Muir and Joseph LeConte
(See U. S. Geological Survey, 1883-84, pp. 31-32, 303-328; 1886-87, I: 261-394;
I. C. Russell, 1897, pp. 37-54; Farquhar, 1926, p. 42).

region, was named for Senator John Conness by Clarence King, later first director
of the United States Geological Survey, but at the time a member of
the Whitney Survey. King and James T. Gardiner were the first to climb the
peak, making the ascent in 1864. Referring to the mountain, King said that
because of its &ldquo;firm peak with titan strength and brow so square and solid, it
seems altogether natural we should have named it for California&rsquo;s statesman,
John Conness.&rdquo;

<h3 id="c15">One Hundred Years in Yosemite</h3>
<p>is a clear story&mdash;sometimes dramatic,
sometimes humorous, always fascinating&mdash;of
the struggles of the many
men who brought about the development
of a great national park from
an unknown wilderness. It is an account
of the men who first battled
with Yosemite Indians, of those who
excited the curiosity of the first tourists
and played critical roles in heralding
the valley of waterfalls, the
back-country haven of peaks, glacial
lakes, and Big Trees.</p>
<p>To this narrative is added the
story behind the later works of men
in the valley&mdash;its trails, roads, hotels,
camps, climbs, and ski runs, and the
tale of the legislative battles over
fixing the park&rsquo;s boundaries and
preventing the overdevelopment
and ruin of an irreplaceable scenic
treasure.</p>
<p>This is not a guidebook to Yosemite,
but a story of men who made
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
possible the existence and enjoyment
of the great park we know
today&mdash;a story which can immeasurably
increase the visitor&rsquo;s enjoyment
of Yosemite. For those who would
pursue this aspect of Californiana
further, there is appended the most
nearly complete of published bibliographies
on Yosemite.</p>
<p>Dr. Russell was for many years the
Yosemite Park Naturalist, charged
with representing Yosemite to the
public. He is now Chief Naturalist
of the National Park Service. His
long list of publications has established
him as an authority in this
field.</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
